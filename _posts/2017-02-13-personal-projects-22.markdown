These [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D8GbM-0ME2dIm54QIPuqB6Pf-iPlhTHlm0a21hk4GjI/edit?usp=sharing) contain a summary of some personal projects from March 13, 2015 to March 13, 2016.

In particular, the personal projects covered in the slides are:

+ recursive closed form finder
+ KnowledgeTools
+ Fermi V4-11
+ ImageCreation V2-5
+ QAAS (Question Asking and Answering Storage)
+ Abstract Government Substructure Optimization
+ QuickReader + MemoryTools
+ Random Attraction simulation
+ Double Infection simulation
+ Image Entropy (early work)
+ LinkSaver
+ MindMap V1&2
+ Stopwatch
+ Playlists
+ Optimal Golomb Ruler Finder
+ Semicontinuous Cellular Automata

Most of these projects arguably deserve a dedicated post and further exploration.
