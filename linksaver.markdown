- "Previous research focused on the actual effect of temperature on the psychological phenomenon known as 'cognitive control,'" says Dr. Shalev. "But this is the first time we were able to measure the effects of perceived temperature."

- Cognitive control is the ability to deliberately inhibit responses or make choices that maximize the long-term best interests of the individual.

- 87 students performed an "anti-saccade task," which requires looking in the opposite direction an object is moving and measures cognitive control. In the second experiment, 28 students were shown images of winter scenery, a temperature-neutral concrete street and a sunny landscape, and told to picture themselves in those settings

- The result indicated that those viewing the cold landscape did better and that even without a physical trigger, cognitive control can be activated through conceptual processes alone

**Keywords:** `cell`, `develop`, `chandelier cell`, `axon`, `synapse`, `neurons`, `cell axon`, `varicosities`

- A basic tenet of neural development is that young neurons make far more connections than they will actually use, with very little specificity. They selectively maintain only the ones that they end up needing

- Once many of these connections are made, the brain employs a use-it or lose-it strategy; if the organism's subsequent experiences stimulate the synapse, it will strengthen and survive. If not, the synapse will weaken and eventually disappear

- a unique type of inhibitory interneuron called chandelier cells -- which are implicated in several diseases affecting the brain such as schizophrenia and epilepsy -- seem to develop their connections differently than other types of neurons.

- Most cells' axons reach out and form synapses on other cells' dendrites or cell bodies, but chandelier cells exclusively inhibitory synapse on other cells' axon initial segments (AIS), right where the cell begins to send its own signal down the axon. At this location, the chandelier cells have a greater impact on other cell's behavior.

**Keywords:** `studies`, `brain`, `associated`, `alcohol consumption`, `cognitive`, `findings`, `drinking`, `alcohol`

- Alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, is associated with increased risk of adverse brain outcomes and steeper decline in cognitive (mental) skills

- Heavy drinking is known to be associated with poor brain health, but few studies have examined the effects of moderate drinking on the brain -- and results are inconsistent.

- They used data on weekly alcohol intake and cognitive performance measured repeatedly over 30 years (1985-2015) for 550 healthy men and women

- After adjusting for these confounders, the researchers found that higher alcohol consumption over the 30 year study period was associated with increased risk of hippocampal atrophy

- Our findings support the recent reduction in UK safe limits and call into question the current US guidelines, which suggest that up to 24.5 units a week is safe for men, as we found increased odds of hippocampal atrophy at just 14-21 units a week, and we found no support for a protective effect of light consumption on brain structure

**Keywords:** `eat`, `food`, `eat alone`, `mirror`, `research`, `social facilitation of eat`, `ate`, `appeal`

- Researchers at Nagoya University reveal that eating in front of a mirror -- or even with a picture of yourself eating -- makes food more appealing.

- People rate food as tasting better, and eat more of it, when they eat with company than when they eat alone. This so-called "social facilitation of eating" is a well-established phenomenon

- wanted to find out what the minimum requirement is for the social facilitation of eating

- In a further experiment, when the researchers replaced the mirror with photos of the volunteers eating, they discovered that the volunteers still experienced an increase in the appeal of food and ate more.

- Studies have shown that for older adults, enjoying food is associated with quality of life, and frequently eating alone is associated with depression and loss of appetite

**Keywords:** `brain`, `computation`, `vision`, `visual`, `object`, `sharpee`, `data`, `process`

- analyzed how neurons in a critical part of the brain, called V2, respond to natural scenes, providing a better understanding of vision processing.

- The team revealed that V2 neurons process visual information according to three principles: first, they combine edges that have similar orientations, increasing robustness of perception to small changes in the position of curves that form object boundaries. 

- Second, if a neuron is activated by an edge of a particular orientation and position, then the orientation 90 degrees from that will be suppressive at the same location, a combination termed "cross-orientation suppression." These cross-oriented edge combinations are assembled in various ways to allow us to detect various visual shapes. The team found that cross-orientation was essential for accurate shape detection.

- The third principle is that relevant patterns are repeated in space in ways that can help perceive textured surfaces of trees or water and boundaries between them, as in impressionist paintings.

- The researchers incorporated the three organizing principles into a model they named the Quadratic Convolutional model

**Keywords:** `prefrontal cortex`, `learn`, `goal`, `hippocampus`, `memories`, `rat learn`, `hippocampal`, `neuron`

- Neurons in the prefrontal cortex "teach" neurons in the hippocampus to "learn" rules that distinguish memory-based predictions in otherwise identical situations, suggesting that learning in the present helps guide learning in the future

- The hippocampus is a temporal lobe brain structure needed for remembering recent events: for example, where you ate your last meal. The prefrontal cortex is where the brain uses context to switch flexibility between remembered rules, such as knowing to look left before crossing a street in North America but right before crossing in Britain. Without such rules, memories interfere with one another and predictions based on memory are inaccurate.

- High-functioning individuals rapidly integrate memories with goals to choose their course of action. This cognitive flexibility requires interaction between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 

- We want to understand how our brains learn to think ahead and the mechanisms that use context to recall events, predict outcomes and inform decisions. For example, how does the brain know to answer a ringing telephone at home but not in someone else's house?

- We already knew that hippocampal cells predicted memory decisions through prospective coding, firing at different rates before rats chose different goals. We learned that inactivating the prefrontal cortex reduced prospective coding by the hippocampus. Furthermore, the more the prefrontal cortex altered hippocampal activity as rats learned one rule, the faster they switched to the next rule

- We found that neuronal activity was synchronized in the two structures, and that neurons in the prefrontal cortex modulated hippocampal place cell activity during learning

**Keywords:** `social capital`, `student`, `school`, `parental`, `teacher`, `goddard`, `levels of social capital`, `factor`

- Most factors that help make schools successful cost lots of money - think teachers, technology and textbooks

- a new study suggests one factor that doesn't need any cash to implement can play an important role in helping students succeed at even the most disadvantaged schools

- That factor is what scientists call social capital: The network of relationships between school officials, teachers, parents and the community that builds trust and norms that promote academic achievement

- In a study of 96 public high schools in Ohio, researchers found that schools with higher levels of social capital also had students who performed better on state-mandated math and reading tests. The results held true as much for urban schools in high-poverty areas as they did for wealthy suburban schools.

- Wealthy schools do have an advantage in terms of social capital, but it is not overwhelming

**Keywords:** `magnet`, `properties`, `layer`, `chromium triiodide`, `material`, `two dimensional`, `2d`, `even`

- After years of searching, many suspected that true two-dimensional magnets might not actually exist. But now we finally have proof - physicists have created the first ever 2D magnet

- They decided to focus on a compound called chromium triiodide (or CrI3), because it's ferromagnetic in its three-dimensional form

- Chromium triiodide is also easily reduced to two dimensions via the 'Scotch tape method' - using adhesive tape to peel off layer after layer until it's just one atom thick

- the researchers tested its magnetic properties by shining a beam of polarised light at its surface. 

- If it was still magnetic, the aligned spin of its electrons could be detected in the reflection of the beam, and sure enough, that's what the team found

- They also discovered that a two-layered sheet of this material isn't magnetic, but when a third is added the substance becomes a ferromagnet again. The material remains magnetic if a fourth layer is added, but gains other properties

**Keywords:** `dlpfc`, `participants`, `problem`, `stimulated`, `solve`, `mental`, `creative`, `tdcs`

- Scientists have found a way to improve creativity through brain stimulation

- achieved this by temporarily suppressing a key part of the frontal brain called the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is involved in most of our thinking and reasoning

- participants who received the intervention showed an enhanced ability to 'think outside the box'

- We solve problems by applying rules we learn from experience, and the DLPFC plays a key role in automating this process

- It works fine most of the time, but fails spectacularly when we encounter new problems which require a new style of thinking -- our past experience can indeed block our creativity

- But the researchers also observed that these participants got worse at solving problems with a higher working memory demand (where many items are needed to be held in mind at once). These problems require the participants to try a number of different moves until finding the solution, which means they have to keep track of their mental operations.

**Keywords:** `neuron`, `decision`, `collect`, `monkey`, `data`, `information`, `single neuron`, `neuroscience`

- When many individual neurons collect data, how do they reach a unanimous decision? 

- as the monkey initially processes the data, polling many neurons is required to get a good prediction of the monkey's decision. Then, as the time for committing to a decision approaches, this pattern shifts. The neurons start to agree and eventually each one on its own is maximally predictive

- at first the "neural voice" is heterogeneous and collective, but as the neurons get close to the decision point, the "neural voice" becomes homogenous and, in a sense, individualistic, as any neuron on its own is sufficient to read the monkey's mind

- a possible explanation for this odd behavior is that the system has two tasks to solve. It must gather good information from noisy data and it must use this information to produce a coherent decision

- an information accumulation phase that uses crowdsourcing to collect reliable information and a consensus phase that allows the system to act

- Many traditional methods of Evolutionary Computation [15-19] can evolve problem solvers with hundreds of parameters, but not millions. Ours can [1,2], by greatly reducing the search space through evolving compact, compressed descriptions [3-8] of huge solvers.

- Back in 1994, our universal [22-25] language for encoding NN was assembler-like [9,10]. In recent work, we replaced it by more practical languages [1-8] based on coefficients of popular transforms (Fourier, wavelet, discrete cosine, etc).

- Look at the weight matrix as if it were an image. We may compress it by encoding it through the coefficients of a Fourier-type transform (here: the discrete cosine transform DCT) [1-8]. While a successful RNN controller may need hundreds of thousands of parameters (weights) to solve its task, its compressed description may need just a few hundred.

**Keywords:** `word`, `neural`, `kimppa`, `exposure`, `learned`, `finnish`, `participants`, `brain`

- A new study has focused on language acquisition in the brain. Even short repetitive exposure to novel words induced a rapid neural response increase that is suggested to manifest memory-trace formation.

- Unlike to existing words, new words showed a neural response enhancement between the early and late stages of exposure on the left frontal and temporal cortices, which was interpreted as the build-up of neural memory circuits. The magnitude of this neural enhancement also correlated with how well the participants remembered the new words afterwards

- To examine the effect of attention, the words were presented for ~30 minutes in two conditions: participants were either passively exposed to the spoken words on the background, or they attended to the speech. Similar neural enhancement to novel words was observed in both listening conditions

**Keywords:** `language`, `bilinguals`, `duration`, `container`, `swedish`, `spanish`, `time`, `passage of time`

- Linguists have discovered that people who speak two languages fluently think about time differently depending on the language context in which they are estimating the duration of events.

- Bilinguals go back and forth between their languages rapidly and, often, unconsciously -- a phenomenon called code-switching.

- But different languages also embody different worldviews, different ways of organizing the world around us. And time is a case in point. For example, Swedish and English speakers prefer to mark the duration of events by referring to physical distances, e.g. a short break, a long wedding, etc. The passage of time is perceived as distance travelled.

- But Greek and Spanish speakers tend to mark time by referring to physical quantities, e.g. a small break, a big wedding. The passage of time is perceived as growing volume.

- There are actually several sources of spontaneous mutation in somatic (nonsex) cells, resulting in every individual containing a multitude of genomes—a situation researchers term somatic mosaicism.

- There are reasons to think somatic mosaicism may be particularly important in the brain, not least because neural genes are very active.

Those "executive functions" of the brain are key factors in determining outcomes, including educational success, drug use, and psychiatric illness.

- study reveals that the maturing brain becomes increasingly segregated into distinct network modules for greater efficiency. Indeed, the new evidence shows that the degree to which executive function improves in a person with age depends on the degree to which that well-defined modular network structure emerges.

- This increasingly modular yet globally integrated network topology may maximize communication efficiency while minimizing wiring costs in the brain.

- persistently poor sleep causes the brain to clear a significant amount of neurons and synaptic connections, and recovering sleep might not be able to reverse the damage

- The microglial cells are responsible for clearing out old and worn out cells via a process called phagocytosis - meaning "to devour" in Greek.

- The astrocytes' job is to prune unnecessary synapses (connections) in the brain to refresh and reshape its wiring. 

- We've known that this process occurs when we sleep to clear away the neurological wear and tear of the day, but now it appears that the same thing happens when we start to lose sleep.

- If replicating genes need energy, and our metabolism is regulated by enzymes made by genes, how could we have genes without a metabolism, and a metabolism without genes?

- we can imagine life emerged as short sections of RNA integrated with energy-releasing reactions that already existed, developing primitive genes that helped bind together other molecules before building into more complex forms.

- Despite its negative reputation, not all worry is destructive or even futile

- worry is associated with recovery from traumatic events, adaptive preparation and planning, recovery from depression, and partaking in activities that promote health, and prevent illness. Furthermore, people who report greater worry may perform better -- in school or at the workplace -- seek more information in response to stressful events, and engage in more successful problem solving

- 1. Worry serves as a cue that the situation is serious and requires action. People use their emotions as a source of information when making judgements and decisions.
2. Worrying about a stressor keeps the stressor at the front of one's mind and prompts people toward action.
3. The unpleasant feeling of worry motivates people to find ways to reduce their worry.

- until now it has been unknown which molecular processes translate environmental changes into the production of new neurons

- a small peptide called DBI (short for: diazepam binding inhibitor) is the crucial mediator in this process. The peptide was first identified because it binds to the receptor for a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA, where it replaces a drug called Diazepam (Valium).

- When DBI was absent, the numbers of neural stem cells in the hippocampus declined. An oversupply of the peptide caused the opposite to happen

- DBI exerts its effect by binding to the receptor for the chemical messenger GABA in the neural stem cells, thus acting as a molecular antagonist of this neurotransmitter.

- GABA is responsible for keeping the stem cells dormant in their niche without dividing

- In several studies in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Marketing Research, students worked and played better when using items they had decorated to portray aspects of themselves.

- Even though participants did not expect any benefit, they threw customized darts more accurately, they came up with more anagrams using a customized pen, and they played a beer-coaster flipping game better with customized coasters. Across the studies, customization boosted performance by 25 percent.

- The trick worked best when people cared about doing well and when the decoration embodied a task-relevant part of their identities

- Animals that have reduced-calorie diets have better mental abilities, and ghrelin might be part of the reason why. Injecting the hormone into mice improves their performance in learning and memory tests, and seems to boost the number of neuron connections in their brains.

- found further evidence that ghrelin can stimulate brain cells to divide and multiply, a process called neurogenesis. When they added the hormone to mouse brain cells grown in a dish, it switched on a gene known to trigger neurogenesis, called fibroblast growth factor.

- new brain cells take a few days to weeks to start working, so people shouldn’t expect fasting to produce immediate effects on their brainpower in this way.

- University students who identify as strong in mathematics quickly forgot much of the material from a mathematics course. The explanation: We tend to forget unpleasant experiences and memories that threaten our self-image as a way to preserve our psychological well-being.

- the researchers found that the students who forgot the most content from the class were those who reported a high level of stress during the course. But, paradoxically, the study also found that the strong relationship between stress level and the tendency to forget course material was most prevalent among the students who are most confident in their own mathematical abilities.

- The phenomenon, which the authors call "motivated forgetting," may occur because students are subconsciously protecting their own self-image as excellent mathematicians

- For the first time, researchers in the field of evolutionary robotics have used physically embodied robots to study epigenetic effects on robot evolution

- In evolutionary robotics, an artificial "gene pool" is created, which produces genomes each of which encodes the control system of a robot. Each robot is then allowed to act and perform tasks according to its "genetically" specified controller, and the robot's fitness is ranked according to how well it performs a certain task. The robots are then allowed to reproduce by swapping genetic material with each other, comparable to biological sexual reproduction

- the genomes of living organisms are also affected by development -- events during their lifetime that lead to epigenetic changes. In biology, this interplay between evolution and development is known as evo-devo, which has emphasized the importance of non-genetic factors on an organism's phenotype

- The results show that robot populations with an epigenetic factor evolved differently than populations where development was not taken into account. Despite the robots not evolving greater light capturing skills, the team are enthusiastic about the results, since the aim of this preliminary study was above all to demonstrate the importance of including epigenetic factors in robot evolution, and to develop a conceptual and physical methodology that makes this possible

- There’s some evidence that people with a greater degree of openness also have better visual awareness. For example, when focusing on letters moving on a screen, they are more likely to notice a grey square appearing elsewhere on the display.

- Antinori and her colleagues asked 123 university students to complete a binocular rivalry test, in which they simultaneously saw a red image with one eye and a green image with the other eye for 2 minutes.

- Usually, the brain can only perceive one image at a time, and most participants reported seeing the image flip between red and green. But some subjects saw the two images fused into a patchwork of red and green – a phenomenon known as “mixed percept”.

- The higher the participants scored for openness on a personality questionnaire, the more they experienced this mixed perception.

- Does the brain create additional synapses from the cortical neurons to the new granule cells, or do some cortical neurons transfer connections from mature granule cells to the new granule cells? Researchers have found that the connections are transferred, without adding to the number of synapses.

- The dentate gyrus is one of just two areas in the brain where new neurons are continuously formed in adults. When a new granule cell neuron is made in the dentate gyrus, it needs to get 'wired in,' by forming synapses, or connections, in order to contribute to circuit function

- Striking electron microscope pictures from inside the brains of mice suggest what happens in our own brain every day: Our synapses -- the junctions between nerve cells -- grow strong and large during the stimulation of daytime, then shrink by nearly 20 percent while we sleep, creating room for more growth and learning the next day.

- The scaling occurred in about 80 percent of the synapses but spared the largest ones, which may be associated with the most stable memory traces.

- A study of neural circuits that underlie memory consolidation reveals memories are formed simultaneously in the hippocampus and long-term storage location of brain's cortex, with long-term memories remaining 'silent' for two weeks before maturing, which upends dominant theories of memory consolidation.

- Just one day after the fear-conditioning event, the researchers found that memories of the event were being stored in engram cells in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. However, the engram cells in the prefrontal cortex were "silent" -- they could stimulate freezing behavior when artificially activated by light, but they did not fire during natural memory recall.

- This study already showed that communication between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus is critical, because blocking the circuit connecting those two regions prevented the cortical memory cells from maturing properly.

- People's ability to make random choices or mimic a random process, such as coming up with hypothetical results for a series of coin flips, peaks around age 25, according to a study.

- Previous studies have shown that aging diminishes a person's ability to behave randomly. However, it had been unclear how this ability evolves over a person's lifetime, nor had it been possible to assess the ways in which humans may behave randomly beyond simple statistical tests.

- The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would "look random to somebody else," 

- The study also demonstrated that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior.

- At around the age of four we suddenly do what three-year-olds are unable to do: put ourselves in someone else's shoes.

- If you tell a 3-year-old child the following story of little Maxi, they will most probably not understand: Maxi puts his chocolate on the kitchen table, then goes to play outside. While he is gone, his mother puts the chocolate in the cupboard. Where will Maxi look for his chocolate whenhe comes back?

- A 3-year-old child will not understand why Maxi would be surprised not to find the chocolate on the table where he left it. It is only by the age of 4 years that a child will correctly predict that Maxi will look for his chocolate where he left it and not in the cupboard where it is now.

- The maturation of fibres of a brain structure called the arcuate fascicle between the ages of three and four years establishes a connection between two critical brain regions: a region at the back of the temporal lobe that supports adult thinking about others and their thoughts, and a region in the frontal lobe that is involved in keeping things at different levels of abstraction

- Neurons are large, tree-like structures made up of a body, the soma, with numerous branches called dendrites extending outward. Somas generate brief electrical pulses called "spikes" in order to connect and communicate with each other. Scientists had generally believed that the somatic spikes activate the dendrites, which passively send currents to other neurons' somas

- the UCLA team discovered that dendrites are not just passive conduits. Their research showed that dendrites are electrically active in animals that are moving around freely, generating nearly 10 times more spikes than somas.

-  These results show that the dendrites do not behave purely like a digital device. Dendrites do generate digital, all-or-none spikes, but they also show large analog fluctuations that are not all or none.

- tested the theory in a series of experiments where people were shown very short video clips of moving objects, then given memory tests. Sometimes the objects appeared to move across the screen as a single object would. Other times they moved in ways we wouldn't expect a single object to move, such as popping out from one side of the screen and then the other.

- In every experiment, subjects had significantly better memories -- as much as nearly 20 percent better -- of trackable objects that moved according to our expectations, the researchers found.

- Among other things, we wanted to know how competent they felt at that particular moment, whether they understood the material or found it a strain to follow the lecture. They were also asked whether they enjoyed the content of the lecture and whether they found it useful

- During a lecture, every single participant experienced phases of high motivation and of strong demotivation -- completely independently of the other students in relation to the timing of those phases

-  The more effort one makes, the more motivated one feels. The reverse is also true: "A person who is motivated also makes more effort,"

- Humans have a type of long-term memory (called 'implicit memory') that means we respond less to stimuli as they are repeated over time, in a process called neural adaptation. But the new research suggests that dyslexics recover faster than non-dyslexics from their responses to stimuli such as sounds and written words, leading to their perceptual and reading difficulties. 

- We decided to test this hypothesis by increasing the length of time between consecutive stimuli and measuring how it affects behavioral biases and neural responses from the auditory cortex, a section of the brain that processes sound.

- Participants with dyslexia showed a faster decay of implicit memory on both measures. This also affected their oral reading rate, which decreased faster as a result of the time interval between reading the same nonword -- a group of letters that looks or sounds like a word -- numerous times

- Rather than having strictly defined routes of communication between different areas, the level of coordination between different parts of the brain seems to ebb and flow. Now, by analyzing the brains of a large number of people at rest or carrying out complex tasks, researchers at have learned that the integration between those brain regions also fluctuates. When the brain is more integrated, people do better on complex tasks.

- the researchers measured pupil size to try and tease out how the brain coordinates this change in connectivity. Pupil size is an indirect measure of the activity of a small region in the brainstem called the locus coeruleus that is thought to amplify or mute signals across the entire brain.

- Up to a certain point, increases in pupil size likely indicate greater amplification of strong signals and greater muting of weak signals across the brain.

- The researchers found that pupil size roughly tracked with changes in brain connectivity during rest, in that larger pupils were associated with greater connectedness. This suggests that the noradrenaline coming from the locus coeruleus might be what drives the brain to become more integrated during highly complicated cognitive tasks, allowing a person to perform well on that task.

- students were shown 24-second clips from 40 films over a period of about half an hour. The study focused on their retention of both the general plot of the films as well as such details as sounds, colors, gestures, background details and other peripheral information that allow a person to re-experience an event in rich and vivid detail

- Researchers also found that giving students a brief visual cue from the movie later -- even a simple glimpse of the title and a little sliver of a screenshot taken from the film -- seemed to jog the memory

- After viewing the film clips, researchers asked what they remembered about the films after delays ranging from several minutes after the showings up to seven days later.

- Researchers found that: (1) all participants recalled less about both the details and the substance of the films over a longer gap of time. But they forgot the perceptual or 'peripheral' details from the films more quickly than the films' central themes. (2) the second group of students, who were given cues before being asked to recall the films, did better at retrieving the faded memory of the peripheral details. However, their retention of central information was not much different from the first group (3) the third group -- who retrieved the memory of the films by telling someone about them soon after viewing -- remembered both central and peripheral information better over time.

- Fast talkers tend to convey less information with each word and syntactic structure than slower-paced speakers, meaning that no matter our pace, we all say just about as much in a given time, a new study finds.

- In information theory, rarer word choices convey greater "lexical information," while more complicated syntax, such as the passive voice, conveys greater "structural information." To stay within the channel, those who talk quickly speak with more common words and simpler syntax, while those with a slower pace tend to use rarer, more unexpected words and more complicated wordings

- analyzed two independent troves of conversational data: the Switchboard Corpus, which contains 2,400 annotated telephone conversations, and the Buckeye Corpus, which consists of 40 lengthy interviews. In total, the data included the speech of 398 people.

- On average, while both men and women exhibited the main trend, men conveyed more information than women at the same speech rate. There is no reason to believe that the ability to convey information at a given rate differs by gender, Cohen Priva said. Instead, he hypothesizes, women may tend to be more concerned with making sure their listeners understand what they are saying.

- Researchers have developed a new computational model of a neural circuit in the brain, which could shed light on the biological role of inhibitory neurons

- The model describes a neural circuit consisting of an array of input neurons and an equivalent number of output neurons. The circuit performs what neuroscientists call a "winner-take-all" operation, in which signals from multiple input neurons induce a signal in just one output neuron.

- the researchers prove that, within the context of their model, a certain configuration of inhibitory neurons provides the most efficient means of enacting a winner-take-all operation

- Signals from the output neurons pass to the inhibitory neurons, whose output in turn passes back to the output neurons. The signaling of the output neurons also feeds back on itself, which proves essential to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- in the brain, increasing the strength of the signal traveling over an input neuron only increases the chances that an output neuron will fire. The same is true of the nodes in the researchers' model. Again, this modification is crucial to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- with only one inhibitory neuron, it's impossible, in the context of their model, to enact the winner-take-all strategy. But two inhibitory neurons are sufficient. The trick is that one of the inhibitory neurons -- which the researchers call a convergence neuron -- sends a strong inhibitory signal if more than one output neuron is firing. The other inhibitory neuron -- the stability neuron -- sends a much weaker signal as long as any output neurons are firing.

- The convergence neuron drives the circuit to select a single output neuron, at which point it stops firing; the stability neuron prevents a second output neuron from becoming active once the convergence neuron has been turned off. The self-feedback circuits from the output neurons enhance this effect.

- Without randomness, however, the circuit won't converge to a single output neuron: Any setting of the inhibitory neurons' weights will affect all the output neurons equally. "You need randomness to break the symmetry,"

- Do real inhibitory neurons exhibit the same division between convergence neurons and stability neurons?

- Many new parents still think that babies should develop at their own pace, and that they shouldn't be challenged to do things that they're not yet ready for.

- this mindset can be traced back to the early 1900s, when professionals were convinced that our genes determine who we are, and that child development occurred independently of the stimulation that a baby is exposed to.

- neurons in the brains of young children quickly increase in both number and specialization as the baby learns new skills and becomes more mobile. Neurons in very young children form up to a thousand new connections per second.

- Van der Meer's research also shows that the development of our brain, sensory perception and motor skills happen in sync. She believes that even the smallest babies must be challenged and stimulated at their level from birth onward. They need to engage their entire body and senses by exploring their world and different materials, both indoors and out and in all types of weather.

-  the experiences must be self-produced; it is not enough for children merely to be carried or pushed in a stroller.

- Babies actually manage to distinguish between the sounds of any language in the world when they are four months old, but by the time they are eight months old they have lost this ability

- Short-term memory traces in the hippocampus, an area deep in the brain, are then relocated to more outer parts of the brain. An international team of neuroscientists now shows how a three-step brain oscillation plays an important part in that process.

- 'Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is responsible for the memory consolidation during our sleep', Bonnefond explains. 'NREM is known for its very slow oscillations (SOs). Other types of oscillations are hidden inside these SOs.

- We discovered that three types of oscillations are nested inside each other in the hippocampus and have a joint function.'

- Slow oscillations only happen about once per second (~0.75 Hz). 

- In a specific time frame within these SOs, Bergmann, Bonnefond and their colleagues found clusters of oscillations of an intermediate speed: the so called spindles which happen about 15 times per second (12 -- 16 Hz). And within these spindles, they found clusters of superfast oscillations called ripples, which happen about 90 times per second (80 -- 100 Hz), and which reflect the local reactivation of the memory trace to be shuttled to the cortex.

- we see that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. And we hypothesize that they provide fine-tuned temporal frames for the transfer of memory traces to the neocortex

- There is evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans, although whether its extent is sufficient to have functional significance has been questioned

- We found that a large subpopulation of hippocampal neurons, constituting one third of the neurons, is subject to exchange. In adult humans, 700 new neurons are added per day, corresponding to an annual turnover of 1.75% of the neurons within the renewing fraction, with a modest decline during aging.

- New neurons integrate throughout life in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of most mammals. The newborn neurons have enhanced synaptic plasticity for a limited time after their differentiation (Ge et al., 2007; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004), which is critical for their role in mediating pattern separation in memory formation and cognition in rodents

- The driver of our instincts is the brainstem -- the region at the very base of your brain, just above the spinal chord. Scientists have known for some time that another brain region, the prefrontal cortex, plays a role in keeping those instincts in check

- Gross and colleagues have literally found the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem.

- went on to confirm that this physical connection was the brake that inhibits instinctive behavior. They found that in mice that have been repeatedly defeated by another mouse -- the murine equivalent to being bullied -- this connection weakens, and the mice act more scared. The scientists found that they could elicit those same fearful behaviors in mice that had never been bullied, simply by using drugs to block the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem

- found that the connection from the prefrontal cortex is to a very specific region of the brainstem, called the PAG, which is responsible for the acting out of our instincts. However, it doesn't affect the hypothalamus, the region that controls feelings and emotions

- So the prefrontal cortex keeps behavior in check, but doesn't affect the underlying instinctive feeling: it stops you from running off-stage, but doesn't abate the butterflies in your stomach

- investigated how the sense of touch of 30 study participants could be changed after a training phase. Half of them received a medium dose of the stress hormone cortisol, while the other half received a placebo drug.

- Tactile performance was assessed using the so-called "two-point discrimination threshold." This marker indicates how far apart two stimuli need to be, to be discriminated as two separate sensations -- the closer they are, the better the sense of touch.

- The placebo group improved their tactile acuity, as expected, by about 15 percent. In contrast, the cortisol given to the other group blocked almost all the stimulation-induced improvement.

- In previous studies on a cellular level, neuroscientists have demonstrated that cortisol suppresses the strengthening of synaptic connections, and therefore the plasticity of the brain -- its ability to learn.

- Until now, the entorhinal cortex has been considered subservient to the hippocampus in both memory formation and recall. But we show that the medial entorhinal cortex can replay the firing pattern associated with moving in a maze independent of the hippocampus

- The entorhinal cortex could be a new system for memory formation that works in parallel to the hippocampus

- When a spatial memory is formed, cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), especially grid cells, act like a navigational system. They provide the hippocampus with information on where an animal is and give cues as to how far and in what direction the animal has moved

- During both sleep and waking periods, the sMEC triggers its own replay and initiates recall and consolidation independent of the hippocampus

-  it seems many mammal babies prefer to approach their mother from one side too – and the explanation may lie in the contrasting talents of each half of the brain

- Some researchers think this explains why human and ape mothers tend to cradle their babies on the left: it is so they can better monitor their facial expressions with their left eye.

- Infants of all species were more likely to position themselves so that their mother was on their left. This happened about three-quarters of the time.

- found that mammal infants who keep their mother on their left are better able to keep track of her and hence increase their chance of survival

- However, if a threat emerges, the roles often reverse, Ingram says. “Infants keep their mother on their left in normal situations such as moving forward or suckling,” she says. “But when faced with stressful situations such as when fleeing, mothers prefer their infant on their left side so they can better monitor them.”

- False memory was discovered in an experiment that asked volunteers to memorise lists of related words and then recall them. When they learned “bed”, “drowsy” and “dream”, about half later also remembered the word “sleep”. 

- well-rested brains normally use “associative memory” to link related concepts together. “There’s a lot of evidence that the brain cares less about individual data and more about the gist of it or what it means,”

- They asked 44 people to memorise lists of words when they were well rested, had slept for only four hours on each of the previous four nights, or hadn’t slept at all for the past 30 hours.

- Unsurprisingly, when they were immediately asked to recall these words, the volunteers did less well when partially or completely sleep-deprived. But when shown a new list and asked which ones had been on the original list, sleep-deprived people were less likely to misremember

- This shows that not only were they less able to learn individual items, they were also less able to extract their meaning.

- "Every time you move your eye, the whole world moves on your retina," says Gaby Maimon, head of the Laboratory of Integrative Brain Function. "But you don't perceive an earthquake happening several times a second."

- the brain can tell if visual motion is self-generated, canceling out information that would otherwise make us feel -- and act -- as if the world was whirling around us.

- Each time you shift your gaze (and you do so several times a second), the brain sends a command to the eyes to move. But a copy of that command is issued internally to the brain's own visual system, as well.

- the common fruit fly performs the same kinds of rapid eye movements. The mere 100,000 neurons in its poppy-seed sized brain must therefore handle the same problems of prediction and perception

- During intentional turns, each neuron received a signal that was carefully calibrated to suppress sensitivity to visual motion along the yaw axis alone

- Scientists have discovered that networks of inhibitory brain cells or neurons develop through a mechanism opposite to the one followed by excitatory networks. Excitatory neurons sculpt and refine maps of the external world throughout development and experience, while inhibitory neurons form maps that become broader with maturation

- The brain represents the external world as specific maps of activity created by networks of neurons

- The studies of excitatory maps have revealed that they begin as a diffuse and overlapping network of cells. "With time," said Arenkiel, "experience sculpts this diffuse pattern of activity into better defined areas, such that individual mouse whiskers, for instance, are represented by discrete segments of the brain cortex.

- Inhibitory neurons are the most abundant type of cells in the mouse brain area dedicated to process scent. To support this network, newly born inhibitory neurons are continually added and integrated into the circuits

- The scientists expected that inhibitory networks would mature in a way similar to that of excitatory networks. That is, the more the animal experienced a scent, the better defined the networks of activity would become

- Surprisingly, the scientists discovered that the inhibitory brain circuits of the mouse sense of smell develop in a manner opposite to the excitatory circuits. Instead of becoming narrowly defined areas, the inhibitory circuits become broader.

- eye contact is one of the most important forms of nonverbal communication

- Human eyes, with their large unpigmented areas, turn out to be great for deducing where someone is looking. This likely makes it all the easier to track someone’s attention

- A recent experiment conducted in Japan suggests that eye contact draws on the same mental resources used for complex tasks, so trying to maintain eye contact can impede your reasoning. In this case, the break in eye contact comes not from emotion, but from the need to preserve cognitive resources. Eye contact can deplete your mental bandwidth.

- Eye contact is something we prefer from birth, but it is not advantageous in every situation. Back in 1998, researchers theorized that averting the gaze from surroundings aids thinking by disengaging from potential distractions around us.

- A decision to express disgust or anger depends on the motives a person seeks to communicate

- a person who expresses disgust is judged to be motivated more by impartial, moral, concerns while a person who expresses anger towards the same immoral act is more likely to be motivated by self-interest.

- participants themselves were more likely to choose to express disgust when their goal was to show that their condemnation of an act was morally motivated, while they chose to express anger when they sought to protest that the act harmed their own interests.

- The findings suggest that disgust is not just an expression of an inner feeling, like nausea or contamination, but a signal that advertises a moral position.

- In an experiment, cognitive psychologists have shown how word comprehension can be sped up – namely by having study participants grasp objects while reading at the same time

- Latest theories in cognitive science research hypothesize that our memory also records physical sensations as part of the words stored

- When the study participants had to grasp an object while reading, their brain processed parts of the meaning of the words earlier than in previous studies in which words were evaluated without something being gripped

- As demonstrated in previous studies, it takes the brain a third of a second to process a word. "In our study, however, we were able to show that comprehension can already begin much earlier, after just a tenth of a second -- if a grasping action is required,"

- This study not only provides evidence that the brain has a common control center for language and movement, but "it also shows that our brain's processing steps shift very quickly and adjust to current tasks

- Using LED lights flickering at a specific frequency, researchers have shown that they can significantly reduce the beta amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease in the visual cortex of mice. This treatment appears to work by stimulating brain waves known as gamma oscillations, which the researchers discovered help the brain suppress beta amyloid production and invigorate cells responsible for destroying the plaques.

- It's a big 'if,' because so many things have been shown to work in mice, only to fail in humans

- Previous studies have hinted that Alzheimer's patients also have impaired gamma oscillations. These brain waves, which range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per second), are believed to contribute to normal brain functions such as attention, perception, and memory.

- After an hour of stimulation at 40 hertz, the researchers found a 40 to 50 percent reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus

- after gamma stimulation, the process for beta amyloid generation is less active

- During consolidation, the brain produces new proteins that strengthen fragile memory traces. However, if a new experience occurs while an existing memory trace is being consolidated, the new stimuli could disrupt the consolidation process

- How does the brain prevent events that occur just after awakening from interrupting the consolidation process?

- The brain partially solves this problem by postponing some of the memory consolidation to a period in which new experiences are minimalized, that is, while we are asleep.

- exposing sea slugs to new stimuli immediately after they wake up does not trigger the formation of new memories

- On awakening, interactions between new experiences and consolidation are prevented because the brain blocks long-term memory arising from the new stimuli. However, when the researchers treated the slugs just prior to the training with a drug that inhibits protein production, they found that the new stimuli could generate long-term memory.

- The major insight from this research is that there is an active process in the brain which inhibits the ability to learn new things and protects the consolidation of memories.

- Every night while you sleep, electrical waves of brain activity circle around each side of your brain, tracing a pattern that, were it on the surface of your head, might look like the twin hair buns of Star Wars' Princess Leia.

- The scale and speed of Princess Leia waves in the cortex is unprecedented, a discovery that advances the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative

- Sleep spindles -- a type of brain wave pattern known to occur in the earliest stages of non-REM sleep -- are associated with memory consolidation. Previous studies showed that the more sleep spindles a human brain exhibits overnight, the more numbers one would remember the next day

- Scientists had long believed that each sleep spindle oscillation peaked at the same time everywhere in the neocortex of the brain

- the sleep spindles weren't peaking simultaneously everywhere in the cortex. Instead, the oscillations were sweeping in circular patterns around and around the neocortex, peaking in one area, and then -- a few milliseconds later -- an adjacent area

- The time scale that these waves travel at is the same speed it takes for neurons to communicate with each other.

- As a memory is being consolidated, Muller and Sejnowski hypothesize, circular sleep spindle waves help form the links between these different aspects of a single memory.

- transposons, small regions of DNA that can move themselves from one part of the genome to another during the lifetime of a cell

- When they move around, they may create mutations in or alter the activity of a functional gene; transposons can therefore create new genetic profiles in a population for natural selection to act on, in either a positive or negative way.

- two types of transposons, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), have a competitive relationship with one another. In order to replicate, SINEs steal the molecular machinery that LINEs use to copy themselves

- predicted that populations of LINE and SINE elements in the genome are expected to oscillate the way those of, for example, wolves and rabbits might

- these oscillations occur over a timescale that is longer than the human lifespan—waves of Alu elements and L1 elements pushing and pulling at each other in slow motion across generations of the human genomes that carry them

- the study showed new protein synthesis in a specific sub-region of the prefrontal cortex known in rodents as the prelimbic. In humans, this area corresponds to the anterior cortex

- when they closely examined the effects on the brain of conditioning rodents with a mild foot shock, the scientists found several messenger RNAs recruited to polyribosomes in the medial prefrontal cortex -- a clear indication of new protein synthesis there

- if they inhibited new protein synthesis in the prelimbic region right after fear conditioning took place, those memories did not form. But if the researchers waited just a few hours, inhibiting protein synthesis in prelimbic cortex had no impact and the memories took hold

- It may be that the first wave of protein synthesis is critical for encoding contextual fear memory, while second wave in other sub-regions is important for memory storage

- Artificial-intelligence system surfs web to improve its performance

- A machine-learning system will generally assign each of its classifications a confidence score, which is a measure of the statistical likelihood that the classification is correct, given the patterns discerned in the training data. With the researchers' new system, if the confidence score is too low, the system automatically generates a web search query designed to pull up texts likely to contain the data it's trying to extract.

- It then attempts to extract the relevant data from one of the new texts and reconciles the results with those of its initial extraction. If the confidence score remains too low, it moves on to the next text pulled up by the search string, and so on.

- Fear of retaliation: Why we tend not to enforce social norms

- The more severe the norm violation, the more reluctant people will be to reprimand the person who committed it. Their fear of retaliation is too great.

- Up to a certain point, we reprimand each other for bad behavior. But in cases of more extreme norm violations, social self-regulation no longer works and we need authorities, police and security personnel.

- For the first time, we have found a connection between the brainstem region involved in arousal and regions involved in awareness, two prerequisites for consciousness

- The researchers analyzed 36 patients with brainstem lesions, of which 12 led to coma and 24 did not. Mapping the injuries revealed that a small "coma-specific" area of the brainstem -- the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum -- was significantly associated with coma

- Their analysis revealed two areas in the cortex of the brain that were significantly connected to the coma-specific region of the brainstem. One sat in the left, ventral, anterior insula (AI), the other in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Both regions have been implicated previously in arousal and awareness.

- A study's participants who were asked to think about their own death before taking to the basketball court scored more points than those in a control group

- the improved performance is the result of a subconscious effort to boost self-esteem, which is a protective buffer against fear of death, according to psychology's terror management theory.

- figured out a model that could explain how we're able to make new memories while keeping old ones intact

- This system used to be characterised as being like a series of dials, which could be turned up or down to determine the signal strength of the synapse

- Another model published in 2005 suggested that each synapse could hold several of these dials

- Now, Fusi and his fellow researchers are proposing that these dials are not only operating at different times – but they're also constantly communicating with each other too

- initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional

- The hippocampal CA3 region plays a key role in learning and memory. One of the most remarkable properties of the network is its ability to retrieve previously stored memories from incomplete or degraded versions, a phenomenon that is widely known as pattern completion.

- It is generally accepted that the synapses between CA3 pyramidal cells, the recurrent CA3-CA3 synapses, play a key role in pattern completion, but how this exactly works has remained enigmatic.

- Previous theories of the hippocampal formation often depicted the CA3 region as a network of highly interconnected cells.

- they found that connectivity was sparse, with an average connection probability of approximately 1%

- Even more surprisingly, they discovered that connectivity in the network is not random, but exhibits connectivity motifs that occur much more frequently than expected for a random network. Thus, the structure of the hippocampal CA3 network may be somewhat reminiscent of a "small world" architecture as found in social networks.

- synaptic connections between two cells are mediated by only one or two synaptic contacts. This is also remarkable because much higher numbers have been found for excitatory synaptic connections in the neocortex

- the design of synaptic connections based on one or two synaptic contacts also seems useful for pattern completion, apparently because it minimizes redundancy in the flow of information in the network. Thus, both macro- (e.g. motifs) and microconnectivity (e.g. properties of connection) facilitate pattern completion in the CA3 cell network.

- Our brains hold on to memories via physical changes in synapses, the tiny connections between neurons. Unexpected molecular mechanisms by which these changes take place have now been revealed

- As we acquire a new memory, the connections, or synapses, between certain sets of neurons strengthen. In particular, the receiving end of a pair of these neurons -- consisting of a little nub called a spine -- gets a little larger.

- The group also was able to add a tiny amount of signaling chemical, glutamate, at the single spine in order to mimic what happens during learning. This caused the spines to grow.

- For some behaviors, a single nerve cell does act as a dictator, triggering an entire set of movements via the electrical signals it uses to send messages.

- But these dictator cells aren’t the whole story. Crayfish can trigger a tail-flip another way too – via another small set of neurons that effectively act as an oligarchy.

- For many other behaviors, however, nervous systems make decisions through something like Sherrington’s “million-fold democracy.”

- Unlike countries, however, nervous systems can implement multiple forms of government simultaneously. A neuronal dictatorship can coexist with an oligarchy or democracy. The dictator, acting fastest, may trigger the onset of a behavior while other neurons fine-tune the ensuing movements.

- Beta rhythms, or waves of brain activity with an approximately 20 Hz frequency, accompany vital fundamental behaviors such as attention, sensation and motion and are associated with some disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

- Scientists have debated how the spontaneous waves emerge, and they have not yet determined whether the waves are just a byproduct of activity, or play a causal role in brain functions.

- They found that they could closely replicate the shape of the beta waves in the model by delivering two kinds of excitatory synaptic stimulation to distinct layers in the cortical columns of cells

- Neither the computer models nor the measurements traced the source of the excitatory synaptic stimulations that drive the pyramidal neurons to produce the beta waves, but Jones and her co-authors posit that they likely come from the thalamus

- piquing people's curiosity can influence their choices by steering them away from tempting desires, like unhealthy foods or taking the elevator, and toward less tempting, but healthier options, such as buying more fresh produce or taking the stairs

- In the first experiment, the researchers approached 200 people in a university library and gave them a choice between two fortune cookies, one plain and one dipped in chocolate and covered in sprinkles

- Participants whose curiosity was piqued (i.e., were told the plain cookie contained a fortune specifically about them) overwhelmingly chose the plain cookie by 71 percent. In contrast, when participants were told nothing, 80 percent chose the chocolate-dipped cookie.

- researchers were able to increase the use of the stairs in a university building nearly 10 percent by posting trivia questions near the elevators and promising the answers in the stairwell.

- For years, researchers have recorded electrical brain activity that oscillates or alternates during sleep; they present as waves on an electroencephalogram (EEG). These waves are called sleep spindles, and scientists have suspected their involvement in cataloging and storing memories as we sleep

- They could've been merely byproducts of other brain processes that enabled what we learn to be stored as a memory. But our study shows that, indeed, the spindles are crucial for the process of creating memories we need for every-day life. And we can target them to enhance memory

- During sleep one of the nights, each person received tACS -- an alternating current of weak electricity synchronized with the brain's natural sleep spindles

- Exaggerating the visual appearance of mistakes could help people further improve their motor skills after an initial performance peak

- healthy participants learned a virtual tetherball-like game in which they tried to hit a target with a ball hanging from a pole. After three days, all players reached a performance plateau. Then, for some players, the researchers secretly manipulated the game so that the distance by which the ball missed the target appeared bigger on screen than it actually was

- Participants whose mistakes appeared at least twice as bad as they really were broke past their plateau and continued sharpening their tetherball skills. A control group that remained undeceived showed negligible improvement

- error exaggeration did not change how they made corrections in their throwing techniques. Instead, it reduced random fluctuations, or noise, in nervous system signals that control muscle movement. These findings challenge existing assumptions that such noise cannot be reduced

- The circadian clock allows us to anticipate predictable changes in our environment that are caused by the Earth's rotation. As such, it makes sure we do our sleeping when it hurts us least, but it doesn't speak to the mystery of why we need to sleep in the first place

- The homeostat measures something -- and we don't know what that something is -- that happens in our brains while we are awake, and when that something hits a certain ceiling, we go to sleep. The system is reset during sleep, and the cycle begins anew when we wake up.

- When two events happen in short succession, they feel somehow linked to each other. It turns out that apparent link has a physical manifestation in our brains

- In your brain, and in the brains of lab mice, recollections are physically represented as collections of neurons with strengthened connections to one another. These clusters of connected cells are known as engrams, or memory traces.

- more excitable neurons—that is, brain cells that activate easily—are more likely to be recruited into an engram, so if you increase the excitability of particular neurons, you can preferentially include them in a new engram.

- Neurons in a newly formed memory trace are subsequently more excitable than neighboring brain cells for a transient period of time. It follows then that a memory formed soon after the first might be encoded in an overlapping population of neurons

- Mice should normally form separate memories when events happen 24 hours apart, but when the researchers re-excited the neurons in the first memory engram while the second memory was forming, they could artificially link those experiences

- Decreasing the excitability of the neurons in the first memory during the second event seemed to prevent the second memory from forming.

- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, also known as BDNF, is a protein[1] that, in humans, is encoded by the BDNF gene.[2][3] BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical Nerve Growth Factor. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery.

- BDNF acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.[4][5] In the brain, it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking

- BDNF expression is significantly enhanced by environmental enrichment and appears to be the primary source of environmental enrichments ability to enhance cognitive processes. Environmental enrichment enhances synaptogenesis, dendridogenesis, and neurogenesis, leading to improved performance on various learning and memory tasks.

- A team of researchers, led by Daniel Levitin of McGill University, has found after analyzing over two thousand pieces of classical music that span four hundred years of history, that virtually all of them follow a one-over-f (1/f) power distribution equation

- One-over-f equations describe the relative frequency of things that happen over time and can be used to describe such naturally occurring events as annual river flooding or the beating of a human heart. They have been used to describe the way pitch is used in music as well, but until now, no one has thought to test the idea that they could be used to describe the rhythm of the music too.

- by adding another variable to the equation, called a beta, which was used to describe just how predictable a given piece was compared to other pieces, they could solve for beta and find a unique number of for each composer.

- Memory recollection usually starts with a cue – a few notes of a jangly doorbell, say, might remind you of a song. Information about the cue is transmitted from your eyes and ears to your brain’s hippocampus, where a set of cells recognise it. These cells then trigger a pattern of activity in the front of the brain that matches that of the memory.

- A 2003 study, cited in a meta-analysis by Henry L. Roediger III and Jeffrey D. Karpicke, highlights the power of testing for making information stick.

- In the study, researchers led by Mark Wheeler had participants either review a list of 40 words five times or review it once and take four recall tests. Then they took a recall test either 5 minutes or one week later.

- participants who'd read the word list five times performed much better on the recall test five minutes later. But participants who'd read the test just once and been tested performed better on the test one week later.

- More recent research suggests that combining testing with immediate feedback (finding out whether you answered right or wrong) is more effective, and can even boost memory right after the information is learned.

- these studies suggest that the most efficient strategy for remembering something - whether you're learning a new language or studying for a science exam - is simply to practice recalling it.

- A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces

- it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum

- Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum

- The use of imagery - where players imagined themselves beating their best score before they played - was effective, too, though not to the same extent as self-talk

- 'If-then planning' - spelling out a course of action and what will happen as a result - was found to be the least effective way of improving performance during the game

- Combining a positive emotional component with a given stimulus promotes memory for future stimuli of the same type

- Our brain, quoting Javiera Oyarzún, first author of the study, "works as a sorting machine. Every time we expose ourselves to a stimulus, our brain sorts it out in a category, such as people, animals, objects, etc. This way, whenever we receive new information we can integrate it with similar available information thanks to our ability to generalize

- we usually do not remember the details surrounding our usual way back home, but if during that time we receive a phone call with good news, or we witness a car accident, we will remember those details with much more precision

- we designed a study with volunteers who were shown a series of images corresponding to two categories (objects and animals), but were only rewarded by one of these categories

- As expected, participants remembered those images associated with a reward better

- In a second session, however, they were shown new images of animals and objects, but knowing that this time there would be no reward. "What we saw is that participants not only remembered "rewarding" images better, but also those of the same semantic category despite knowing that they were not associated with any reward,"

- One of the most significant aspects of the published work is that the effects of emotionally positive stimuli on memory storage are not observed until after 24 hours, ie, it is necessary that the participant sleeps.

- adolescents who sleep five hours a night for a week experience significant cognitive degradation

- For seven nights, half of the participants received a five-hour sleep opportunity, while the other half had nine hours to sleep -- the recommended sleep duration for this age group 

- Those in the nine-hour sleep group either maintained cognitive performance or showed practice-related gains in tasks requiring arithmetic calculation and symbol decoding. In contrast, those in the five-hour sleep group showed prominent deterioration of sustained attention, working memory, executive function, alertness, and positive mood. They also showed reduced performance gains (arising from repeated practice) with arithmetic and symbol-decoding

- two nights of nine-hour recovery sleep could not fully reverse some of these cognitive deficits

- the 'Johnny Depp Effect' -- which involves women tending to prefer men with more feminine faces -- holds in some contexts, but not in others

- when people are asked to rate the attractiveness of gender-blended face morphs they tend to judge them as less appealing if they are first asked to classify the face as male or female

- gender blends were disliked when, and only when, the faces were first categorised by gender, despite an overall preference of the participants for more feminine features

- In the second experiment, in which some participants were first asked to categorise gender-ambiguous faces by ethnicity, they did not subsequently judge the gender blends as less appealing.

- mental effort of having to assign a gender to an ambiguous face has a flow-on effect of negatively influencing how we feel about that face

- The first study to systematically measure the number of neurons in the brains of birds has found that they have significantly more neurons packed into their small brains than are stuffed into mammalian and even primate brains of the same mass.

- studies found that the birds could manufacture and use tools, use insight to solve problems, make inferences about cause-effect relationships, recognize themselves in a mirror and plan for future needs, among other cognitive skills previously considered the exclusive domain of primates

- Birds can perform these complex behaviors because birds' forebrains contain a lot more neurons than any one had previously thought -- as many as in mid-sized primates

- Previously, neuroanatomists thought that as brains grew larger neurons had to grow bigger as well because they had to connect over longer distances. "But bird brains show that there are other ways to add neurons: keep most neurons small and locally connected and only allow a small percentage to grow large enough to make the longer connections.

- Gross and colleagues studied the hippocampus, a region of the brain that's long been known to help form memories. Information enters this part of the brain through three different routes. As memories are cemented, connections between neurons along the 'main' route become stronger.

- When they blocked this main route, the scientists found that the mice were no longer capable of learning a Pavlovian response -- associating a sound to a consequence, and anticipating that consequence. But if the mice had learned that association before the scientists stopped information flow in that main route, they could still retrieve that memory

- blocking that main route had an unexpected consequence: the connections along it were weakened, meaning the memory was being erased

- this active push for forgetting only happens in learning situations

- research suggests that there is an "atomic" unit of recognition -- a minimum amount of information an image must contain for recognition to occur

- When the scientists compared the scores of the human subjects with those of the computer models, they found that humans were much better at identifying partial- or low-resolution images

- Almost all the human participants were successful at identifying the objects in the various images, up to a fairly high loss of detail -- after which, nearly everyone stumbled at the exact same point. The division was so sharp, the scientists termed it a "phase transition." "If an already minimal image loses just a minute amount of detail, everybody suddenly loses the ability to identify the object," says Ullman. "That hints that no matter what our life experience or training, object recognition is hardwired and works the same in all of us."

- A new equation, showing how our happiness depends not only on what happens to us but also how this compares to other people, has been developed by UCL researchers funded by Wellcome

- found that inequality reduced happiness on average. This was true whether people were doing better or worse than another person they had just met

- On average, when someone won a gamble they were happier when their partner also won the same gamble compared to when their partner lost. This difference could be attributed to guilt. Similarly, when people lost a gamble they were happier when their partner also lost compared to when their partner won, a difference that could be attributed to envy.

- The people who gave away half of their money when they had the opportunity showed no envy when they experienced inequality in a different task but showed a lot of guilt. By contrast, those who kept all the money for themselves displayed no signs of guilt in the other task but displayed a lot of envy

- The task may prove to be a useful way of measuring empathy, which could offer insight into social disorders such as borderline personality disorder

Instead short trees are thin and tall ones thick. Even more, thicker trees have larger defects, such as knots, where stress concentrates when a tree bends.

- In each experiment, individuals were asked to participate in an activity (e.g., taking a bus tour or eating in a food court) and were either instructed to take photos during the activity or not.

- One critical factor that has been shown to affect enjoyment is the extent to which people are engaged with the experience

- Another instance where photo-taking did not appear to increase enjoyment was when taking photos interfered with the experience itself, such as having to handle bulky and unwieldy camera equipment.

- During sensory stimulation, increases in blood flow are not precisely 'tuned' to local neural activity

- Kara and colleagues showed that, while blood flow did increase with neural activity, it also increased in response to certain sensory stimuli that did not evoke local neural activity

- Kara and colleagues have devised a hypothesis. "The blood vessel dilation triggered by local, selective neural activity does not remain entirely local," says Kara. "From a vessel deep within the brain, the dilation propagates up along the vessel walls into a surface vessel and then down into other vessels that enter neighboring columns."

- Researchers have created a digital audio platform that can modify the emotional tone of people's voices while they are talking, to make them sound happier, sadder or more fearful. New results show that while listening to their altered voices, participants' emotional state change in accordance with the new emotion

- what regulates our ability to store and recall information? New research suggests one of the processes involved is 'anti-memories' – connections between neurons that generate the exact opposite pattern of electrical activity to that of the original memory

- The 'anti-memories' hypothesis comes back to the idea that healthy brain function results from the interaction between two types of brain cells: excitatory and inhibitory neurons

- without this balancing of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) functions, overly excited neurons could give rise to conditions like epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism

- memories are stored in balanced E/I cortical ensembles

- anti-memories "appear to allow multiple memories to be stored in the brain, without interference between these memories"

- How the brain consolidates memory during deep sleep

- Using a computational model, study explains how hippocampus influences synaptic connections in cortex

- During sleep, human and animal brains are primarily decoupled from sensory input. Nevertheless, the brain remains highly active, showing electrical activity in the form of sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (a small region of the brain that forms part of the limbic system) and large-amplitude slow oscillations in the cortex (the outer layer of the cerebrum)

- Traces of episodic memory acquired during wakefulness and initially stored in the hippocampus are progressively transferred to the cortex as long-term memory during sleep

- patterns of slow oscillations in the cortex, which their model spontaneously generates, are influenced by the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and that these patterns of slow oscillations determine synaptic changes in the cortex

- During such memory replay, the corresponding synapses are strengthened for long-term storage in the cortex

- A notable property is the closure of the set of all G-functions not only under differentiation but also under indefinite integration. In combination with a functional equation that allows to liberate from a G-function G(z) any factor zρ that is a constant power of its argument z, the closure implies that whenever a function is expressible as a G-function of a constant multiple of some constant power of the function argument, f(x) = G(cxγ), the derivative and the antiderivative of this function are expressible so too.

- If someone is absorbed in what they are watching or doing -- what Dr Witchel calls 'rapt engagement' -- there is a decrease in these involuntary movements.

- The scenario involves a wooden cube with 6-cm sides made of medium-density fiberboard. Each of the six faces is marked with a 6 x 6-cm square lattice for a total of 36 square cells per face. Then round holes (of diameter equal to the length of a square cell) are drilled through random cells all the way through the cube.

- the number of holes that needs to be drilled to collapse this particular cube is always around 13 holes in each of the three directions, or 39 holes total. Their formula shows that, although this critical number changes for different lattice sizes, the critical density of drills is very similar.

- What the researchers discovered when studying Synechocystis – a species of cyanobacteria found in freshwater lakes and rivers – is that their cell bodies act like a lens. When light hits the spherical surface of the cell, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused internal spot, towards the source of the light, with the cells using tiny tentacle-like structures called pili to pull themselves forwards.

- Research has examined whether using performance brands such as Nike and 3M had any effect on consumers' output

- The effect is strongest among people who are novices in the respective task, such as golf putting or math tests, whereas experts receive little or no boost

- Our results indicate that strong performance brands can cause an effect that is akin to a placebo effect

- This higher self-esteem lowers their performance anxiety which, in turn, leads to the better performance outcomes

- Individuals addicted to cocaine may have difficulty in controlling their addiction because of a previously-unknown 'back door' into the brain, circumventing their self-control, suggests a new study.

- The basolateral amygdala stores the pleasurable memories associated with cocaine, but the pre-frontal cortex manipulates this information, helping an individual to weigh up whether or not to take the drug: if an addicted individual takes the drug, this activates mechanisms in the dorsal striatum

- The pathway links the basolateral amygdala indirectly with the dorsolateral striatum, circumventing the prefrontal cortex. This means that an addicted individual would not necessarily be aware of their desire to take the drug.

- Cannabis increases the noise in your brain

- Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study shows that this active ingredient increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.
