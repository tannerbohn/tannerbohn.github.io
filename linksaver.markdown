`notifications`, `fitz`, `phone`, `study`, `batch`, `feel`, `people`, `control`

- found that batching notifications into sets that study participants receive three times a day makes them happier, less stressed, feeling more productive, and more in control.

- works better than getting notifications normally, getting them once per hour, or even than blocking them of completely.

- analysed the notifications that people got on their phones and found that the average person got between 65 and 80 notifications per day (people may check their phones more frequently, that's just the number of notifications that show up)

- The ideal system might be location aware and give you your first batch of notifications as you arrive at work or hop on the subway, a second batch at the end of a lunchbreak, and a third batch as you head home for the evening

`attention`, `artwork`, `picture`, `dr thomas`, `person`, `art`, `abstract`, `emotional`

- the same piece of artwork can attract admiration or rejection from different people

- Volunteers were psychologically assessed in relation to their personality and then shown abstract art pictures. They were asked to rate the pictures and say how much they would pay for them. The participants' eye movements were tracked as they looked at the images

- relationship between personality traits and artwork preferences was already well established. Scientists knew, for instance, that neurotic people found abstract and pop art more appealing

- people who tended towards neuroticism paid more attention to the left side of a picture, and those with traits related to schizophrenia looked less often at the top of a picture

- we tend to look to the left side of images first and the fact that these individuals spent more time looking at the left overall suggests they find it harder to disengage their attention

- In contrast to people with these particular personality traits, she said, in general, participants' eye movements were concentrated in the upper right quadrant of their visual field

`visual`, `brain`, `twilight`, `resting activity`, `perception`, `signal`, `studied`, `stimuli`

- twilight was a dangerous time for humans since they were at risk of encountering nocturnal predators. Anyone still able to recognise things despite the weak light was at a clear evolutionary advantage

- brain prepares for dawn and dusk by shutting down resting activity in the visual cortex at these times so that weak visual stimuli do not disappear in the brain's background noise

- Since resting activity during twilight decreases not only in the visual but also in the auditory and somatosensory regions of the brain, the researchers assume that perception sharpens not only in the visual system

`noun`, `predict`, `study`, `word`, `brain`, `replicability`, `neuroscience`, `kite`

- It is assumed that our brain routinely uses clues within a sentence to estimate the probability of upcoming words. Activating information about a word before it appears helps to rapidly integrate its meaning, once it appears, with the meaning of the sentence.

- 334 participants -- 10 times the original amount -- read sentences that were presented one word at a time, while electrical brain activity was recorded at the scalp. Each sentence contained an expected or unexpected combination of an article and a noun (e.g., "The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a kite/an airplane")

- We saw that unexpected nouns generated an increased brain response compared to expected nouns. Just like the original study

- Even though 'a' and 'an' do not differ in their meaning, the 2005 study showed that unexpected articles also elicited an enhanced N400 response compared to expected articles

- Crucially, our findings now show that there is no convincing evidence for this claim

`read`, `students`, `print`, `digital`, `text`, `comprehension`, `better`, `medium`

- Students said they preferred and performed better when reading on screens. But their actual performance tended to suffer.

- students were able to better comprehend information in print for texts that were more than a page in length

- This appears to be related to the disruptive effect that scrolling has on comprehension

- The medium didn't matter for general questions (like understanding the main idea of the text). But when it came to specific questions, comprehension was significantly better when participants read printed texts.

- we found a select group of undergraduates who actually comprehended better when they moved from print to digital.
What distinguished this atypical group was that they actually read slower when the text was on the computer than when it was in a book

`memories`, `miller`, `capacities`, `load`, `studies`, `research`, `regions`, `memories capacities`

- Maximum working memory capacity -- for instance the total number of images a person can hold in working memory at the same time -- varies by individual but averages about four

- "At peak memory load, the brain signals that maintain memories and guide actions based on these memories, reach their maximum," Pinotsis said. "Above this peak, the same signals break down."

- Visual working memory is distinct for each side of the visual field. People have independent capacities on their left and their right, research has confirmed

`brain`, `wave`, `actively`, `ultra slow wave`, `slow`, `research`, `mri`, `electrical actively`

- If you keep a close eye on an MRI scan of the brain, you'll see a wave pass through the entire brain like a heartbeat once every few seconds

- like waves in the sea, with everything the brain does taking place in boats upon that sea. Research to date has been focused on the goings-on inside the boats, without much thought for the sea itself. But the new information suggests that the waves play a central role in how the complex brain coordinates itself and that the waves are directly linked to consciousness.

- These slowly varying signals in the brain are a way to get a very large-scale coordination of the activities in all the diverse areas of the brain

- found that the ultra-slow waves spontaneously started in a deep layer of mice's brains and spread in a predictable trajectory. As the waves passed through each area of the brain, they enhanced the electrical activity there. Neurons fired more enthusiastically when a wave was in the vicinity

- the ultra-slow waves persisted when the mice were put under general anesthesia, but with the direction of the waves reversed.

He designed 100 of this puzzles, to be a good benchmark for pattern recognition abilities, and they seem to be challenging for both people and algorithms

- Six images on the left conform to a rule, or a pattern, and the six images on the right conform to a different rule (usually an opposite). To solve the problem, one needs to understand the pattern and to figure out the rule (which is the solution).

- Brain areas tend to be organized in a hierarchy, ranging from "lower" sensory areas to "higher" cognitive areas

- Unexpectedly, our model reveals that only when the signal is strong enough, above a threshold level, the signal reaches a large set of areas of the brain region called the prefrontal cortex, which plays a critical role in high-level cognition

- As the longest-running longitudinal survey of intellectually talented children, SMPY has for 45 years tracked the careers and accomplishments of some 5,000 individuals, many of whom have gone on to become high-achieving scientists

- The SMPY data supported the idea of accelerating fast learners by allowing them to skip school grades

- Many educators and parents continue to believe that acceleration is bad for children—that it will hurt them socially, push them out of childhood or create knowledge gaps. But education researchers generally agree that acceleration benefits the vast majority of gifted children socially and emotionally, as well as academically and professionally

- In the study, 13 participants 60 and older received one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation. The sham stimulation procedure was identical to the acoustic one, but participants did not hear any noise during sleep. For both the sham and acoustic stimulation sessions, the individuals took a memory test at night and again the next morning. Recall ability after the sham stimulation generally improved on the morning test by a few percent. However, the average improvement was three times larger after pink-noise stimulation.

- Previous research showed acoustic simulation played during deep sleep could improve memory consolidation in young people

- The study used a new approach, which reads an individual's brain waves in real time and locks in the gentle sound stimulation during a precise moment of neuron communication during deep sleep, which varies for each person

**Gist: When word and shape pair are presented to slowly fade into conscious awareness, it happens faster when the pair is congruent (kiki-sharp, bubu-round).**

- To participants' dominant eye, the researchers presented a series of flashing images; to the nondominant eye, they presented a target image that gradually faded in. Initially, participants were unaware of the target image and could only see the competing, flashing images

- the target image was always a nonsense word, bubu or kiki, inside of a shape. Sometimes the word (bubu) was congruent with the shape it was in (round) and sometimes it was incongruent with the shape (angular). The participants pressed a key whenever the target image became visible

- Timing data showed that the target image broke through to conscious awareness faster when it was congruent than when it was incongruent, indicating that participants perceived and processed the relationship between word and shape before they were consciously aware of the stimuli

`learned`, `environment`, `brain`, `metaplasticity`, `reward`, `synapses`, `learned rate`, `studies`

- there's not a single rate of learning for everything we do, as the brain can self-adjust its learning rates using a synaptic mechanism called metaplasticity

- One of the most complex problems in learning is how to adjust to uncertainty and the rapid changes that take place in the environment. It is very exciting to find that synapses, the simplest computational elements in the brain, can provide a robust solution for such challenges

- When things change frequently, a large learning rate is required but this reduces precision, whereas, a stable environment requires a small learning rate, which improves precision. The study illustrates how metaplasticity can mitigate the tradeoff between adaptability and precision in learning

- Increased letter spacing helps individuals read faster, but not due to visual processing, according to new research

- letter-spacing effect, which is this finding that both kids and adults with or without specific reading impairment read faster and more fluidly when you increase the spaces between letters in words

- Everybody seemed pretty certain up until this point that it was about decluttering your visual scene, which may make identifying letters easier," said Sacchi. "What my results show is that it doesn't look like the effect is happening early enough to be related to visual processing

- Increased spacing was very helpful for the words, and less helpful for the pseudo-words and the consonant strings. The fact that more "word-like" stimuli benefited more than less "word-like" stimuli suggests that the benefit is occurring during a reading-specific process, rather than during a purely visual stage

- In 2003, Saxe first showed that theory of mind is seated in a brain region known as the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). The TPJ coordinates with other regions, including several parts of the prefrontal cortex, to form a network that is active when people think about the mental states of others

`learn`, `brain`, `task`, `neuron`, `activity`, `research`, `change`, `carnegie mellon`

- the brain has various mechanisms and constraints by which it reorganizes its neural activity when learning over the course of a few hours. The new research finds that, when learning a new task, the brain is less flexible than previously thought

- When we're learning a new task, we can't instantaneously learn it to proficiency, in part due to the way in which the neurons are wired up in the brain. Learning takes time, and there are mechanisms by which neurons can change the way they communicate with each other to enable learning -- some of which can be fast, and some of which can take longer.

- When we learn, at first the brain tends to not produce new activity patterns, but to repurpose the activity patterns it already knows how to generate

- By repurposing neuron patterns the brain is already capable of generating, the brain applies a "quick and dirty fix" to the new problem it's facing

- despite Broca's area being one of the most studied human brain regions, neuroscientists are still not exactly sure what the same region does, on the other side of the brain

- Theory suggests the right hemisphere equivalent, or homologue, of Broca's area plays a similar role but for the processing of music instead of language

`dog`, `speech`, `human`, `adult`, `babies`, `interact`, `speaker`, `adult dog`

- Speech interaction experiments between adult dogs and humans showed that so called "dog-speak" improves attention and may help humans to socially bond with their pets

- A special speech register, known as infant-directed speech, is thought to aid language acquisition and improve the way a human baby bonds with an adult

- found that adult dogs were more likely to want to interact and spend time with the speaker that used dog-directed speech with dog-related content, than they did those that used adult-directed speech with no dog-related content

- When we mixed-up the two types of speech and content, the dogs showed no preference for one speaker over the other. This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.

`word`, `sense`, `language`, `mean`, `emerge`, `cognitive`, `human`, `word sense`

- words accumulate families of related senses over the course of history. For instance, the word 'face' originally meant the front part of a head, but over time it also came to mean the front part of other objects, such as the 'face' of the cliff, and an emotional state, such as putting on a brave 'face.'

- identified an algorithm called "nearest-neighbor chaining" as the mechanism that best describes how word senses accumulate over time

- findings suggest that word senses emerge in ways that minimize cognitive costs, which are the collective costs of generating, interpreting and learning word senses. In other words, new word senses emerge through an efficient mechanism that expresses new ideas via a compact set of words

- Over the past millennium, word senses have largely evolved from literal domains to metaphorical domains -- called metaphorical mapping

**Gist: There is a specific brain signal present when a listener understands what they have heard (absent when not understood or not paying attention) and reflects how similar or different a word is from those that precede it.**

- identified a specific brain signal associated with the conversion of speech into understanding. The signal is present when the listener has understood what they have heard, but it is absent when they either did not understand, or weren't paying attention

- shows that our brains perform a rapid computation of the similarity in meaning that each word has to the words that have come immediately before it

- To test if human brains actually compute the similarity between words as we listen to speech, the researchers recorded electrical brainwave signals recorded from the human scalp -- a technique known as electroencephalography or EEG -- as participants listened to a number of audiobooks

- by analysing their brain activity, they identified a specific brain response that reflected how similar or different a given word was from the words that preceded it in the story

And fasting beforehand heightened this effect.

- Much research has gone into the effect glucose has on cognitive function. For people of all ages, the substance seems to have a positive effect on memory function

- They were then given a drink which contained either glucose, sucrose, fructose or the placebo sucralose. After a 20-minute interval, they were given cognitive function tests

- These were designed to test  information processing, executive function, and selective attention, all of which are associated with the prefrontal lobe

- participants who consumed glucose and sucrose were slower by a mean of up to 200 milliseconds, or 0.2 seconds, in answering questions

- As the dog stares, the hormone oxytocin floods the owner’s brain, causing him or her to lavish attention on the canine, which experiences a similar spike in the hormone and proceeds to stare even harder

- One possibility is that short-term eye contact is used as a social reference in observing the human’s behavior, while maintaining eye contact is related to manipulating the human’s behavior when asking for help

- The longer staring bouts of dogs, which lasted an average of 40 seconds (compared with just three seconds for dingoes and less than a second for wolves), may be required to kick-start the oxytocin response in humans

`neuron`, `predict`, `theories`, `previous`, `code`, `framework`, `encode`, `signal`

- One of the main goals of sensory neuroscience is to predict neural responses using mathematical models. Previously, these predictions were based on three main theories, each of which had a different area of applicability, corresponding to varying assumptions about the neurons' internal constraints, the type of signal, and the purpose of the gathered information

- a neural code is essentially a function that predicts when a neuron should "fire,"

- Efficient coding assumes that the neurons encode as much information as possible, given their internal constraints (noise, metabolism, etc.).

- Predictive coding, on the other hand, assumes that only the information relevant to predicting the future (e.g. which way an insect will fly) is encoded

- sparse coding assumes that only a few neurons are active at any one time

- In the context of the team's framework, a neural code can be interpreted as the code that maximizes a certain mathematical function. This function -- and thus, the neural code maximizing it -- depends on three parameters: the noise in the signal, the goal or task (i.e. if the signal will be used to predict the future), and the complexity of the signal being encoded

- However, mood in mature adults (over 30 years) may be more reliant on food that increases availability of antioxidants (fruits) and abstinence of food that inappropriately activates the sympathetic nervous system (coffee, high glycemic index and skipping breakfast)

- Regular consumption of meat leads to build-up of two brain chemicals (serotonin and dopamine) known to promote mood. Regular exercise leads to build-up of these and other neurotransmitters as well

- discovered that the fruit fly brain has an elegant and efficient method of performing similarity searches

- it helps them identify odors that are most similar to those they've encountered before, so they know how to behave in response to the odor

- when fruit flies first sense an odor, 50 neurons fire in a combination that's unique to that smell. But rather than hashing that information by reducing the number of hashes associated with the odor, as computer programs would, flies do the opposite -- they expand the dimension

- The 50 initial neurons lead to 2,000 neurons, spreading out the input so that each smell has an even more distinct fingerprint among those 2,000 neurons. The brain then stores only the 5 percent of those 2,000 neurons with the top activity as the "hash" for that odor. The whole paradigm helps the brain notice similarities better than it would compared to reducing the dimension

- When they applied the process to three standard datasets computer scientists use to test search algorithms, they found that the fly approach improved performance

Researchers used high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) to synchronize oscillations between them, improving brain processing. De-synchronizing did the opposite

- medial frontal cortex the "alarm bell of the brain."

- "If you make an error, this brain area fires," says Reinhart, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University. "If I tell you that you make an error, it also fires. If something surprises you, it fires."

-  this region of the brain works hand in hand (or perhaps lobe in lobe) with a nearby region, the lateral prefrontal cortex, an area that stores rules and goals and also plays an important role in changing our decisions and actions

- Research has recently suggested that populations of millions of cells in the medial frontal cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex may communicate with each other through the precise timing of their synchronized oscillations, and these brain rhythms appear to occur at a relatively low frequency (about four to eight cycles per second)

- Our new theory thinks about navigation as part of the more general problem of computing plans that maximise future reward

- The key computational idea we drew on is that to estimate future reward, an agent must first estimate how much immediate reward it expects to receive in each state, and then weight this expected reward by how often it expects to visit that state in the future. By summing up this weighted reward across all possible states, the agent obtains an estimate of future reward

- we argue that the hippocampus represents every situation - or state - in terms of the future states which it predicts

- By representing each current state in terms of its anticipated successor states, the hippocampus conveys a compact summary of future events, known formally as the “successor representation”

- Research has shown that there is a lot of price dispersion in online stores. If customers want to save money, they should search on many different platforms, especially with travel products like flights and hotels

- When a host store sells its in-store advertising space to a competitor, this allows uninformed customers to become aware of substitute offerings in the marketplace and possibly migrate to the competing store, Zia said. The host store may benefit from a commission for customers it sends to the competitor

- it might be optimal for Expedia to increase its average price in order to motivate these customers to click on the link," Zia said. "Because Priceline knows these customers have already observed high prices, that website also can raise prices. So the average prices will be higher on both stores

- Icy materials in space could behave like liquids at low temperatures and under ultraviolet light, suggests new research

- To mimic interstellar conditions, Tachibana and his colleagues sprayed a mixture of water, methanol and ammonia onto a substrate, chilling it to between -263°C (-441°F) and -258°C (-432°F), and dousing it in ultraviolet light.

- After the ice had formed, the scientists slowly raised the temperature and observed it under a microscope. At temperatures between -210°C (-346°F) and -120C (-184°F), it bubbled like boiling water, with a viscosity similar to honey.

- caused by methanol and ammonia being broken up by UV irradiation. As the hydrogen bonds are rearranged, the ice's viscosity is lowered at the same time

**Gist: Unsupervised learning in a resettable, explorable environment can be achieved with a pair of agents, A, which tries to reach a state specified by B, and B, which tried to specify a state that takes A the longest time while still being possible.**

- An overview of current trends for feature learning in the unsupervised way

- Unsupervised learning by predicting the noise [Bojanowski & Joulin ICML17] 

- Discovering causal signals in images [Lopez-Paz et al. CVPR17]

- Object features and anticausal features are closely related and vice-versa context features and causal features are not necessarily related.

- a causal feature would be indeed the Savanna’s visual patterns and an anticausal feature would be the lion’s mane.

- Intrinsic motivation and automatic curricula via asymmetric self-play [Sukhbaatar et al. arXiv17]

- An initial phase of self-playing is set up by splitting the agent into “two separate minds”, Alice and Bob. The authors propose self-playing under the assumption that the environment has to be (nearly) reversible or resettable to the initial state. In this case, Alice executes a task and asks Bob to do the same, by reaching the same observable state of the world where Alice ended up

- Alice and Bob have their distinct rewards functions. Bob has to minimize the time for completion, while Alice is rewarded when Bob takes more time, while being able to achieve the goal. The interplay between these policies allow them to “automatically construct a curriculum of exploration”.

- They tested the idea on a few environments and on a version of StarCraft without enemies to fight. “The target task is to build Marine units. To do this, an agent must follow a specific sequence of operations

- On a final note, it isn’t just that just unsupervised learning is hard, but measuring its performance is even harder

- The ventral pathway, on the other hand, sees objects as they always are regardless of the task

**Gist: In those with chronic tinnitus, the precuneus is more connected to the dorsal attention network (active when something holds your attention) and less connected to default mode network (active when at rest and not focused).**

- found that chronic tinnitus is associated with changes in certain networks in the brain, and furthermore, those changes cause the brain to stay more at attention and less at rest

- The precuneus is connected to two inversely related networks in the brain: the dorsal attention network, which is active when something holds a person's attention; and the default mode network, which are the "background" functions of the brain when the person is at rest and not thinking of anything in particular.

- When the default mode network is on, the dorsal attention network is off, and vice versa. We found that the precuneus in tinnitus patients seems to be playing a role in that relationship

- in patients with chronic tinnitus, the precuneus is more connected to the dorsal attention network and less connected to the default mode network

`mutate`, `cell`, `houseley`, `gene`, `mechanism`, `adapt`, `copies`, `yeast`

- DNA often contains multiple copies of extended sequences of base pairs or even whole genes. The exact number can vary among individuals because, when cells are duplicating their DNA before cell division, certain mistakes can insert or delete copies of gene sequences

- CUP1, a gene that helps yeast resist the toxic effects of environmental copper. They found that when yeast was exposed to copper, the variation in the number of copies of CUP1 in the cells increased. On average, most cells had fewer copies of the gene, but the yeast cells that gained more copies—about 10 percent of the total population — became more resistant to copper and flourished

- when cells replicate their DNA, the replication mechanism sometimes stalls. Usually the mechanism can restart and pick up where it left off. When it can’t, the cell can go back to the beginning of the replication process, but in doing so, it sometimes accidentally deletes a gene sequence or makes extra copies of it. That is what causes normal copy number variation

- Houseley and his team made the case that a combination of factors makes these copying errors especially likely to hit genes that are actively responding to environmental stresses, which means that they are more likely to show copy number variation

- Magneto-thermal stimulation involves using magnetic nanoparticles to stimulate neurons outfitted with temperature-sensitive ion channels. The brain cells fire when the nanoparticles are heated by an external magnetic field, causing the channels to open.

- First, scientists use genetic engineering to introduce a special strand of DNA into targeted neurons, causing these cells to produce a heat-activated ion channel. Then, researchers inject specially crafted magnetic nanoparticles into the same area of the brain. These nanoparticles latch onto the surface of the targeted neurons, forming a thin covering like the skin of an onion.

- During all three activities, there was a measured increase in bloodflow in the brain's prefrontal cortex, compared to rest periods where bloodflow decreased to normal rates.

- Doodling in or around the circle had the highest average measured bloodflow increase in the reward pathway compared to free-drawing (the next highest) and coloring. However, the difference between each form of art-making was not statistically significant, according to analysis

- Doodling seemed to initiate the most brain activity in artists, but free-drawing was observed to be about the same for artists and non-artists. Interestingly, the set coloring activity actually resulted in negative brain activity in artists.

- Mitochondrial flash or 'mitoflash' was first identified by Dr. CHENG Heping's team at PKU as a quantized signal at single-mitochondrion level, involving mitochondrial events such as membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and matrix alkalization that last for tens of seconds. 

- hypothesized that mitoflash might be involved in signaling transduction of synaptic plasticity

- found that synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) was always accompanied by one or more mitoflashes in nearby dendritic mitochondria after chemical, electrical or glutamate uncaging induced LTP

- artificially induced mitoflashes could in turn facilitate transition from short-term synaptic potentiation to long-term potentiation

- Further study revealed that synaptic calcium and calcium-calmodulin kinase was important for eliciting mitoflash, which in turn released ROS to signal long-term synaptic plasticity

**Gist: Brief reactivation of a learned memory (quickly typing numbers with one hand)  in temporal proximity of a very similar task (typing numbers with the other hand) gives that memory long-term immunity to interference with other tasks during multi-tasking.**

- research identifies a brain mechanism that enables more efficient multitasking. The key to this is "reactivating the learned memory," a process that allows a person to more efficiently learn or engage in two tasks in close conjunction

- When we learn a new task, we have great difficulty performing it and learning something else at the same time

- This is due to interference between the two tasks, which compete for the same brain resources

- Our research demonstrates that the brief reactivation of a single learned memory, in appropriate conditions, enables the long-term prevention of, or immunity to, future interference in the performance of another task performed in close conjunction

- researchers first taught student volunteers to perform a sequence of motor finger movements with one hand, by learning to tap onto a keypad a specific string of digits appearing on a computer screen as quickly and accurately as possible. After acquiring this learned motor memory, the memory was reactivated on a different day, during which the participants were required to briefly engage with the task -- this time with an addition of brief exposure to the same motor task performed with their other hand

- By utilizing the memory reactivation paradigm, the subjects were able to perform the two tasks without interference

- By uniquely pairing the brief reactivation of the original memory with the exposure to a new memory, long-term immunity to future interference was created, demonstrating a prevention of interference even a month after the exposures.

- A new review paper proposes that the goal of memory is not to transmit the most accurate information over time, but to guide and optimize intelligent decision making by only holding on to valuable information

- It's important that the brain forgets irrelevant details and instead focuses on the stuff that's going to help make decisions in the real world

- We find plenty of evidence from recent research that there are mechanisms that promote memory loss, and that these are distinct from those involved in storing information

- forgetting allows us to adapt to new situations by letting go of outdated and potentially misleading information that can no longer help us maneuver changing environments

- The second way forgetting facilitates decision making is by allowing us to generalize past events to new ones. In artificial intelligence this principle is called regularization and it works by creating simple computer models that prioritize core information but eliminate specific details, allowing for wider application

- A constantly changing environment may require that we remember less

**Gist: Multitasking while studying impairs memory, but still able to strategically identify and remember the most important information.**

- Multitasking while studying may impair overall memory for the study material, but your ability to strategically identify and remember the most important information may stay intact

- researchers asked 192 undergraduate student participants to view a series of word lists and remember as many words as possible. Importantly, each word had a numerical value, from 1 to 10, and participants were instructed to maximize the total value of the words they recalled

- Students randomly assigned to the divided attention group studied the word lists as digits were also being read aloud -- they were instructed to press a key every time they heard three odd digits in a row. Other students studied the lists while lyrical music, with which they were familiar or unfamiliar, played in the background. Another group of students studied with no additional distractions.

- As expected, those students who were forced to divide their attention between the word list and the digits recalled fewer words compared with the students in the other groups. The data showed that the background music had no discernible effect on students' overall recall.

- students really did seem to pay attention to the value of the words -- their odds of recalling a 10-point word were almost five times greater than their odds of recalling a 1-point word.

- Most adults can quickly and effortlessly recall as many as 100,000 regularly used words when prompted, but how the brain accomplishes this has long boggled scientists. How does the brain nearly always find the needle in the haystack?

- Previous work has revealed that the brain organizes ideas and words into semantically related clusters

- They measured the separate neuronal processes involved with first activating the item's conceptual cluster, then selecting the proper word. Surprisingly, they discovered the two processes actually happen at the same time and activate a much wider network of brain regions than previously suspected.

- As expected, two regions known to be involved in language processing lit up, the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior temporal cortex. But so did several other regions not traditionally linked to language, including the medial and middle frontal gyri

**Gist: The fronto-parietal network appears to perform emulation, evidenced by the commonality of its deverse functions (planning and executing, mental rotation, working memory, etc.).**

- fronto-parietal network is responsible for a range of highly diverse functions, from planning and executing movements to mental rotation, and from spatial attention to working memory. But how can a single network participate in such a wide variety of functions?

- recently put forward an original hypothesis -- all these cognitive functions rely on one central function: emulation

- the fronto-parietal network is activated by very disparate tasks. This is the case for motor activities, such as picking up or pointing to an object, as well as for eye movements -- and even when no movement is involved, if we shift our attention or perform a mental calculation

- A review of all the data currently available suggests that the tasks share a common process, which the scientists have termed "emulation." This process, which consists of planning and representing a movement without actually performing it, activates the brain network in the same way as real movements.

- "But we hypothesise that the brain goes a step further," explains Dr Ptak: "It uses such dynamic representations to carry out increasingly complex cognitive functions beyond just planning movements."

-  the skier who mentally rehearses his race before starting improves his performance. Such anticipated action prepares him for movements that are more accurate and precise.

- We wanted to find a way to solve a problem without using the normal binary representations that have been the backbone of computing for decades

- Their new system employs a network of electronic oscillators to solve graph coloring tasks -- a type of problem that tends to choke modern computers

- In natural forms of computing, dynamical systems with complex interdependencies evolve rapidly and solve complex sets of equations in a massively parallel fashion.

- When a group of oscillators were electrically connected via capacitive links, they automatically synchronized to the same frequency -- oscillating at the same rate. Meanwhile, oscillators directly connected to one another would operate at different phases within the same frequency, and oscillators in the same group but not directly connected would sync in both frequency and phase

- The next step would be building a larger network of oscillators that could handle graph coloring problems with more objects at play

- the brain's ability to perform "approximate probabilistic inference" cannot be truly studied with simple tasks that are "ill-suited to expose the inferential computations that make the brain special."

- "Evolution has given us what we call a good model bias," Pitkow said. "It's been known for a couple of decades that very simple neural networks can compute any function, but those universal networks can be enormous

- "In contrast, if you have the right kind of model -- not a completely general model that could learn anything, but a more limited model that can learn specific things, especially the kind of things that often happen in the real world -- then you have a model that's biased. In this sense, bias can be a positive trait

- They suggested that the brain infers solutions based on statistical crosstalk between redundant population codes. Population codes are responses by collections of neurons that are sensitive to certain inputs, like the shape or movement of an object.

- to better understand the brain, it can be more useful to describe what these populations compute, rather than precisely how each individual neuron computes it. Pitkow said this means thinking "at the representational level" rather than the "mechanistic level,"

`farmer`, `plant`, `pest`, `optimal`, `system`, `decisions`, `water`, `reach`

- Bali's famous rice terraces, when seen from above, look like colorful mosaics because some farmers plant synchronously, while others plant at different times

- Farmers that live upstream have the advantage of always having water; while those downstream have to adapt their planning on the schedules of the upstream farmers

- When farmers are planting at different times, pests can move from one field to another, but when farmers plant in synchrony, pests drown and the pest load is reduced. So upstream farmers have an incentive to share water so that synchronous planting can happen. However, water resources are limited and there is not enough water for everybody to plant at the same time

- As a result of this constraint, fractal planting patterns emerge, which yield close to maximal harvests

- this optimal situation arises without central planners or coordination. Farmers interact locally and take local individual free decisions, which they believe will optimize their own harvest

- this is in contrast to the tragedy of the commons, where the global optimum is not reached because everyone is maximizing his individual profit

- The team studied DRNDA neurons in mice, which are a model organism for studying the human brain. First, the team measured DRNDA activity while the animals encountered salient stimuli, such as the arrival of a potential mating partner, or a sudden unpleasant sensation, or food. The DRNDA neurons were highly active during these events

- these neurons are least active when the animal is sleeping and increase in activity as the animal is waking up

- After stimulating these neurons with light during the time that the animal would normally sleep, Gradinaru and her team found that the mouse woke up from sleep and remained awake. The reverse was true when the activity of DRNDA was chemically silenced -- the animal was likely to fall asleep, even in the face of motivationally important stimuli, such as the odor of a predator or a mating partner

- Cognitive control is the ability to deliberately inhibit responses or make choices that maximize the long-term best interests of the individual.

- 87 students performed an "anti-saccade task," which requires looking in the opposite direction an object is moving and measures cognitive control. In the second experiment, 28 students were shown images of winter scenery, a temperature-neutral concrete street and a sunny landscape, and told to picture themselves in those settings

- The result indicated that those viewing the cold landscape did better and that even without a physical trigger, cognitive control can be activated through conceptual processes alone

- A basic tenet of neural development is that young neurons make far more connections than they will actually use, with very little specificity. They selectively maintain only the ones that they end up needing

- Once many of these connections are made, the brain employs a use-it or lose-it strategy; if the organism's subsequent experiences stimulate the synapse, it will strengthen and survive. If not, the synapse will weaken and eventually disappear

- a unique type of inhibitory interneuron called chandelier cells -- which are implicated in several diseases affecting the brain such as schizophrenia and epilepsy -- seem to develop their connections differently than other types of neurons.

- Most cells' axons reach out and form synapses on other cells' dendrites or cell bodies, but chandelier cells exclusively inhibitory synapse on other cells' axon initial segments (AIS), right where the cell begins to send its own signal down the axon. At this location, the chandelier cells have a greater impact on other cell's behavior.

- Alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, is associated with increased risk of adverse brain outcomes and steeper decline in cognitive (mental) skills

- They used data on weekly alcohol intake and cognitive performance measured repeatedly over 30 years (1985-2015) for 550 healthy men and women

- After adjusting for these confounders, the researchers found that higher alcohol consumption over the 30 year study period was associated with increased risk of hippocampal atrophy

- Our findings support the recent reduction in UK safe limits and call into question the current US guidelines, which suggest that up to 24.5 units a week is safe for men, as we found increased odds of hippocampal atrophy at just 14-21 units a week, and we found no support for a protective effect of light consumption on brain structure

- analyzed how neurons in a critical part of the brain, called V2, respond to natural scenes, providing a better understanding of vision processing.

- The team revealed that V2 neurons process visual information according to three principles: first, they combine edges that have similar orientations, increasing robustness of perception to small changes in the position of curves that form object boundaries. 

- Second, if a neuron is activated by an edge of a particular orientation and position, then the orientation 90 degrees from that will be suppressive at the same location, a combination termed "cross-orientation suppression." These cross-oriented edge combinations are assembled in various ways to allow us to detect various visual shapes. The team found that cross-orientation was essential for accurate shape detection.

- The third principle is that relevant patterns are repeated in space in ways that can help perceive textured surfaces of trees or water and boundaries between them, as in impressionist paintings.

- The researchers incorporated the three organizing principles into a model they named the Quadratic Convolutional model

**Gist: Hippocampal cells predict memory decisions through prospective coding, and the prefrontal cortex teaches the hippocampus to learn rules to distinguism memory-based predictions in otherwise identical situations (ex. you answer a telephone in your own home but not a stranger's).**

- Neurons in the prefrontal cortex "teach" neurons in the hippocampus to "learn" rules that distinguish memory-based predictions in otherwise identical situations, suggesting that learning in the present helps guide learning in the future

- The hippocampus is a temporal lobe brain structure needed for remembering recent events: for example, where you ate your last meal. The prefrontal cortex is where the brain uses context to switch flexibility between remembered rules, such as knowing to look left before crossing a street in North America but right before crossing in Britain. Without such rules, memories interfere with one another and predictions based on memory are inaccurate.

- High-functioning individuals rapidly integrate memories with goals to choose their course of action. This cognitive flexibility requires interaction between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 

- We want to understand how our brains learn to think ahead and the mechanisms that use context to recall events, predict outcomes and inform decisions. For example, how does the brain know to answer a ringing telephone at home but not in someone else's house?

- We already knew that hippocampal cells predicted memory decisions through prospective coding, firing at different rates before rats chose different goals. We learned that inactivating the prefrontal cortex reduced prospective coding by the hippocampus. Furthermore, the more the prefrontal cortex altered hippocampal activity as rats learned one rule, the faster they switched to the next rule

- We found that neuronal activity was synchronized in the two structures, and that neurons in the prefrontal cortex modulated hippocampal place cell activity during learning

- In a study of 96 public high schools in Ohio, researchers found that schools with higher levels of social capital also had students who performed better on state-mandated math and reading tests. The results held true as much for urban schools in high-poverty areas as they did for wealthy suburban schools.

- They decided to focus on a compound called chromium triiodide (or CrI3), because it's ferromagnetic in its three-dimensional form

- Chromium triiodide is also easily reduced to two dimensions via the 'Scotch tape method' - using adhesive tape to peel off layer after layer until it's just one atom thick

- the researchers tested its magnetic properties by shining a beam of polarised light at its surface. 

- If it was still magnetic, the aligned spin of its electrons could be detected in the reflection of the beam, and sure enough, that's what the team found

- They also discovered that a two-layered sheet of this material isn't magnetic, but when a third is added the substance becomes a ferromagnet again. The material remains magnetic if a fourth layer is added, but gains other properties

- We solve problems by applying rules we learn from experience, and the DLPFC plays a key role in automating this process

- It works fine most of the time, but fails spectacularly when we encounter new problems which require a new style of thinking -- our past experience can indeed block our creativity

- But the researchers also observed that these participants got worse at solving problems with a higher working memory demand (where many items are needed to be held in mind at once). These problems require the participants to try a number of different moves until finding the solution, which means they have to keep track of their mental operations.

`neuron`, `decision`, `collect`, `monkey`, `data`, `information`, `single neuron`, `neuroscience`

- When many individual neurons collect data, how do they reach a unanimous decision? 

- as the monkey initially processes the data, polling many neurons is required to get a good prediction of the monkey's decision. Then, as the time for committing to a decision approaches, this pattern shifts. The neurons start to agree and eventually each one on its own is maximally predictive

- at first the "neural voice" is heterogeneous and collective, but as the neurons get close to the decision point, the "neural voice" becomes homogenous and, in a sense, individualistic, as any neuron on its own is sufficient to read the monkey's mind

- a possible explanation for this odd behavior is that the system has two tasks to solve. It must gather good information from noisy data and it must use this information to produce a coherent decision

- an information accumulation phase that uses crowdsourcing to collect reliable information and a consensus phase that allows the system to act

The magnitude of this neural enhancement also correlated with how well the participants remembered the new words afterwards

- To examine the effect of attention, the words were presented for ~30 minutes in two conditions: participants were either passively exposed to the spoken words on the background, or they attended to the speech. Similar neural enhancement to novel words was observed in both listening conditions

- Accepted dogma holds that—although every cell in the body contains its own DNA—the genetic instructions in each cell nucleus are identical. But new research has now proved this assumption wrong.

- There are actually several sources of spontaneous mutation in somatic (nonsex) cells, resulting in every individual containing a multitude of genomes—a situation researchers term somatic mosaicism.

- There are reasons to think somatic mosaicism may be particularly important in the brain, not least because neural genes are very active.

- Since a gazelle can run faster than a lion, how do lions ever catch gazelles? A new model of predator-prey interaction shows how groups of predators use collective chasing strategies, such as cornering and circling, to pursue and capture faster prey. Without this tactical collaboration, the predators would have no chance of catching these prey.

- As children age into adolescence and on into young adulthood, they show dramatic improvements in their ability to control impulses, stay organized, and make decisions. Those "executive functions" of the brain are key factors in determining outcomes, including educational success, drug use, and psychiatric illness.

- study reveals that the maturing brain becomes increasingly segregated into distinct network modules for greater efficiency. Indeed, the new evidence shows that the degree to which executive function improves in a person with age depends on the degree to which that well-defined modular network structure emerges.

- This increasingly modular yet globally integrated network topology may maximize communication efficiency while minimizing wiring costs in the brain.

- persistently poor sleep causes the brain to clear a significant amount of neurons and synaptic connections, and recovering sleep might not be able to reverse the damage

- The microglial cells are responsible for clearing out old and worn out cells via a process called phagocytosis - meaning "to devour" in Greek.

- The astrocytes' job is to prune unnecessary synapses (connections) in the brain to refresh and reshape its wiring. 

- We've known that this process occurs when we sleep to clear away the neurological wear and tear of the day, but now it appears that the same thing happens when we start to lose sleep.

- ost of the synapses that were getting eaten in the two groups of sleep-deprived mice were the largest ones, which tend to be the oldest and most heavily used

- Despite its negative reputation, not all worry is destructive or even futile

- worry is associated with recovery from traumatic events, adaptive preparation and planning, recovery from depression, and partaking in activities that promote health, and prevent illness. Furthermore, people who report greater worry may perform better -- in school or at the workplace -- seek more information in response to stressful events, and engage in more successful problem solving

- 1. Worry serves as a cue that the situation is serious and requires action. People use their emotions as a source of information when making judgements and decisions.
2. Worrying about a stressor keeps the stressor at the front of one's mind and prompts people toward action.
3. The unpleasant feeling of worry motivates people to find ways to reduce their worry.

- until now it has been unknown which molecular processes translate environmental changes into the production of new neurons

- a small peptide called DBI (short for: diazepam binding inhibitor) is the crucial mediator in this process. The peptide was first identified because it binds to the receptor for a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA, where it replaces a drug called Diazepam (Valium).

- When DBI was absent, the numbers of neural stem cells in the hippocampus declined. An oversupply of the peptide caused the opposite to happen

- DBI exerts its effect by binding to the receptor for the chemical messenger GABA in the neural stem cells, thus acting as a molecular antagonist of this neurotransmitter.

- GABA is responsible for keeping the stem cells dormant in their niche without dividing

But, paradoxically, the study also found that the strong relationship between stress level and the tendency to forget course material was most prevalent among the students who are most confident in their own mathematical abilities.

- The phenomenon, which the authors call "motivated forgetting," may occur because students are subconsciously protecting their own self-image as excellent mathematicians

**Gist: The interplay between evolution and epigenetic changes (development) over a lifetime is called evo-devo.**

- For the first time, researchers in the field of evolutionary robotics have used physically embodied robots to study epigenetic effects on robot evolution

- In evolutionary robotics, an artificial "gene pool" is created, which produces genomes each of which encodes the control system of a robot. Each robot is then allowed to act and perform tasks according to its "genetically" specified controller, and the robot's fitness is ranked according to how well it performs a certain task. The robots are then allowed to reproduce by swapping genetic material with each other, comparable to biological sexual reproduction

- the genomes of living organisms are also affected by development -- events during their lifetime that lead to epigenetic changes. In biology, this interplay between evolution and development is known as evo-devo, which has emphasized the importance of non-genetic factors on an organism's phenotype

- The results show that robot populations with an epigenetic factor evolved differently than populations where development was not taken into account. Despite the robots not evolving greater light capturing skills, the team are enthusiastic about the results, since the aim of this preliminary study was above all to demonstrate the importance of including epigenetic factors in robot evolution, and to develop a conceptual and physical methodology that makes this possible

- There’s some evidence that people with a greater degree of openness also have better visual awareness. For example, when focusing on letters moving on a screen, they are more likely to notice a grey square appearing elsewhere on the display.

- Antinori and her colleagues asked 123 university students to complete a binocular rivalry test, in which they simultaneously saw a red image with one eye and a green image with the other eye for 2 minutes.

- Usually, the brain can only perceive one image at a time, and most participants reported seeing the image flip between red and green. But some subjects saw the two images fused into a patchwork of red and green – a phenomenon known as “mixed percept”.

- The higher the participants scored for openness on a personality questionnaire, the more they experienced this mixed perception.

Researchers have found that the connections are transferred, without adding to the number of synapses.

- The dentate gyrus is one of just two areas in the brain where new neurons are continuously formed in adults. When a new granule cell neuron is made in the dentate gyrus, it needs to get 'wired in,' by forming synapses, or connections, in order to contribute to circuit function

- A study of neural circuits that underlie memory consolidation reveals memories are formed simultaneously in the hippocampus and long-term storage location of brain's cortex, with long-term memories remaining 'silent' for two weeks before maturing, which upends dominant theories of memory consolidation.

- Just one day after the fear-conditioning event, the researchers found that memories of the event were being stored in engram cells in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. However, the engram cells in the prefrontal cortex were "silent" -- they could stimulate freezing behavior when artificially activated by light, but they did not fire during natural memory recall.

- This study already showed that communication between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus is critical, because blocking the circuit connecting those two regions prevented the cortical memory cells from maturing properly.

- Previous studies have shown that aging diminishes a person's ability to behave randomly. However, it had been unclear how this ability evolves over a person's lifetime, nor had it been possible to assess the ways in which humans may behave randomly beyond simple statistical tests.

- The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would "look random to somebody else," 

- The study also demonstrated that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior.

- If you tell a 3-year-old child the following story of little Maxi, they will most probably not understand: Maxi puts his chocolate on the kitchen table, then goes to play outside. While he is gone, his mother puts the chocolate in the cupboard. Where will Maxi look for his chocolate whenhe comes back?

- A 3-year-old child will not understand why Maxi would be surprised not to find the chocolate on the table where he left it. It is only by the age of 4 years that a child will correctly predict that Maxi will look for his chocolate where he left it and not in the cupboard where it is now.

- The maturation of fibres of a brain structure called the arcuate fascicle between the ages of three and four years establishes a connection between two critical brain regions: a region at the back of the temporal lobe that supports adult thinking about others and their thoughts, and a region in the frontal lobe that is involved in keeping things at different levels of abstraction

- Neurons are large, tree-like structures made up of a body, the soma, with numerous branches called dendrites extending outward. Somas generate brief electrical pulses called "spikes" in order to connect and communicate with each other. Scientists had generally believed that the somatic spikes activate the dendrites, which passively send currents to other neurons' somas

- the UCLA team discovered that dendrites are not just passive conduits. Their research showed that dendrites are electrically active in animals that are moving around freely, generating nearly 10 times more spikes than somas.

-  These results show that the dendrites do not behave purely like a digital device. Dendrites do generate digital, all-or-none spikes, but they also show large analog fluctuations that are not all or none.

Sometimes the objects appeared to move across the screen as a single object would. Other times they moved in ways we wouldn't expect a single object to move, such as popping out from one side of the screen and then the other.

- the release of the chemical 'acetylcholine' fluctuates during the day but found that the release is at its highest when the brain is engaged with more challenging mental tasks. The fluctuations are coordinated across the brain indicating a brain-wide signal to increase mental capacity with specific spikes in acetylcholine release occurring at particularly arousing times such as gaining reward.

- Humans have a type of long-term memory (called 'implicit memory') that means we respond less to stimuli as they are repeated over time, in a process called neural adaptation. But the new research suggests that dyslexics recover faster than non-dyslexics from their responses to stimuli such as sounds and written words, leading to their perceptual and reading difficulties. 

- We decided to test this hypothesis by increasing the length of time between consecutive stimuli and measuring how it affects behavioral biases and neural responses from the auditory cortex, a section of the brain that processes sound.

- Participants with dyslexia showed a faster decay of implicit memory on both measures. This also affected their oral reading rate, which decreased faster as a result of the time interval between reading the same nonword -- a group of letters that looks or sounds like a word -- numerous times

`brain`, `pupil size`, `researchers`, `integrated`, `task`, `greater`, `locus coeruleus`, `mute`

- Rather than having strictly defined routes of communication between different areas, the level of coordination between different parts of the brain seems to ebb and flow. Now, by analyzing the brains of a large number of people at rest or carrying out complex tasks, researchers at have learned that the integration between those brain regions also fluctuates. When the brain is more integrated, people do better on complex tasks.

- the researchers measured pupil size to try and tease out how the brain coordinates this change in connectivity. Pupil size is an indirect measure of the activity of a small region in the brainstem called the locus coeruleus that is thought to amplify or mute signals across the entire brain.

- Up to a certain point, increases in pupil size likely indicate greater amplification of strong signals and greater muting of weak signals across the brain.

- The researchers found that pupil size roughly tracked with changes in brain connectivity during rest, in that larger pupils were associated with greater connectedness. This suggests that the noradrenaline coming from the locus coeruleus might be what drives the brain to become more integrated during highly complicated cognitive tasks, allowing a person to perform well on that task.

- In the number connection challenge shown in Fig1A, participants are asked to connect numbers in an assigned order

- In the Knowledge Quiz Training Game (KQTG, shown in Fig1D), participants select the correct pronunciation of Kanji characters

- Seventy-two older adults between the age of 60-75 were randomly assigned to either a PSTG or a KQTG group. They were asked to play PSTG (12 processing speed games) or KQTG (4 knowledge quizzes) for 4 weeks. They played for 15 minutes a day, for at least 5 days a week.

- Cognitive functions and emotional states were measured before and after the 4-week intervention period. And results showed that participants who played PSTG had improved processing speed and inhibitions, as well as reduced depressive moods compared to those who played KQTG.

- Students who are given information and tell someone about it immediately recall the details better and longer

- students were shown 24-second clips from 40 films over a period of about half an hour. The study focused on their retention of both the general plot of the films as well as such details as sounds, colors, gestures, background details and other peripheral information that allow a person to re-experience an event in rich and vivid detail

- Researchers also found that giving students a brief visual cue from the movie later -- even a simple glimpse of the title and a little sliver of a screenshot taken from the film -- seemed to jog the memory

- After viewing the film clips, researchers asked what they remembered about the films after delays ranging from several minutes after the showings up to seven days later.

- Researchers found that: (1) all participants recalled less about both the details and the substance of the films over a longer gap of time. But they forgot the perceptual or 'peripheral' details from the films more quickly than the films' central themes. (2) the second group of students, who were given cues before being asked to recall the films, did better at retrieving the faded memory of the peripheral details. However, their retention of central information was not much different from the first group (3) the third group -- who retrieved the memory of the films by telling someone about them soon after viewing -- remembered both central and peripheral information better over time.

- Fast talkers tend to convey less information with each word and syntactic structure than slower-paced speakers, meaning that no matter our pace, we all say just about as much in a given time, a new study finds.

- In information theory, rarer word choices convey greater "lexical information," while more complicated syntax, such as the passive voice, conveys greater "structural information." To stay within the channel, those who talk quickly speak with more common words and simpler syntax, while those with a slower pace tend to use rarer, more unexpected words and more complicated wordings

- analyzed two independent troves of conversational data: the Switchboard Corpus, which contains 2,400 annotated telephone conversations, and the Buckeye Corpus, which consists of 40 lengthy interviews. In total, the data included the speech of 398 people.

- On average, while both men and women exhibited the main trend, men conveyed more information than women at the same speech rate. There is no reason to believe that the ability to convey information at a given rate differs by gender, Cohen Priva said. Instead, he hypothesizes, women may tend to be more concerned with making sure their listeners understand what they are saying.

**Gist: According to simulations, inhibitory neurons (stimuated by first activated neuron to suppress others in a group) useful for efficient "winner-take-all" dynamics**

- Researchers have developed a new computational model of a neural circuit in the brain, which could shed light on the biological role of inhibitory neurons

- The model describes a neural circuit consisting of an array of input neurons and an equivalent number of output neurons. The circuit performs what neuroscientists call a "winner-take-all" operation, in which signals from multiple input neurons induce a signal in just one output neuron.

- the researchers prove that, within the context of their model, a certain configuration of inhibitory neurons provides the most efficient means of enacting a winner-take-all operation

- Signals from the output neurons pass to the inhibitory neurons, whose output in turn passes back to the output neurons. The signaling of the output neurons also feeds back on itself, which proves essential to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- in the brain, increasing the strength of the signal traveling over an input neuron only increases the chances that an output neuron will fire. The same is true of the nodes in the researchers' model. Again, this modification is crucial to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- with only one inhibitory neuron, it's impossible, in the context of their model, to enact the winner-take-all strategy. But two inhibitory neurons are sufficient. The trick is that one of the inhibitory neurons -- which the researchers call a convergence neuron -- sends a strong inhibitory signal if more than one output neuron is firing. The other inhibitory neuron -- the stability neuron -- sends a much weaker signal as long as any output neurons are firing.

- The convergence neuron drives the circuit to select a single output neuron, at which point it stops firing; the stability neuron prevents a second output neuron from becoming active once the convergence neuron has been turned off. The self-feedback circuits from the output neurons enhance this effect.

- Without randomness, however, the circuit won't converge to a single output neuron: Any setting of the inhibitory neurons' weights will affect all the output neurons equally. "You need randomness to break the symmetry,"

- Do real inhibitory neurons exhibit the same division between convergence neurons and stability neurons?

`babies`, `develop`, `stimulated`, `neurons`, `challenged`, `brain`, `skills`, `must`

- Many new parents still think that babies should develop at their own pace, and that they shouldn't be challenged to do things that they're not yet ready for.

- this mindset can be traced back to the early 1900s, when professionals were convinced that our genes determine who we are, and that child development occurred independently of the stimulation that a baby is exposed to.

- neurons in the brains of young children quickly increase in both number and specialization as the baby learns new skills and becomes more mobile. Neurons in very young children form up to a thousand new connections per second.

- Van der Meer's research also shows that the development of our brain, sensory perception and motor skills happen in sync. She believes that even the smallest babies must be challenged and stimulated at their level from birth onward. They need to engage their entire body and senses by exploring their world and different materials, both indoors and out and in all types of weather.

-  the experiences must be self-produced; it is not enough for children merely to be carried or pushed in a stroller.

- Babies actually manage to distinguish between the sounds of any language in the world when they are four months old, but by the time they are eight months old they have lost this ability

- Short-term memory traces in the hippocampus, an area deep in the brain, are then relocated to more outer parts of the brain. An international team of neuroscientists now shows how a three-step brain oscillation plays an important part in that process.

- 'Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is responsible for the memory consolidation during our sleep', Bonnefond explains. 'NREM is known for its very slow oscillations (SOs). Other types of oscillations are hidden inside these SOs.

- We discovered that three types of oscillations are nested inside each other in the hippocampus and have a joint function.'

- Slow oscillations only happen about once per second (~0.75 Hz). 

- In a specific time frame within these SOs, Bergmann, Bonnefond and their colleagues found clusters of oscillations of an intermediate speed: the so called spindles which happen about 15 times per second (12 -- 16 Hz). And within these spindles, they found clusters of superfast oscillations called ripples, which happen about 90 times per second (80 -- 100 Hz), and which reflect the local reactivation of the memory trace to be shuttled to the cortex.

- we see that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. And we hypothesize that they provide fine-tuned temporal frames for the transfer of memory traces to the neocortex

`neurons`, `hippocampal`, `adult humans`, `et al`, `700`, `75`, `subpopulation`, `hieber`

- There is evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans, although whether its extent is sufficient to have functional significance has been questioned

- We found that a large subpopulation of hippocampal neurons, constituting one third of the neurons, is subject to exchange. In adult humans, 700 new neurons are added per day, corresponding to an annual turnover of 1.75% of the neurons within the renewing fraction, with a modest decline during aging.

- New neurons integrate throughout life in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of most mammals. The newborn neurons have enhanced synaptic plasticity for a limited time after their differentiation (Ge et al., 2007; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004), which is critical for their role in mediating pattern separation in memory formation and cognition in rodents

`instinctive`, `prefrontal cortex`, `connection`, `brainstem`, `region`, `mice`, `behavior`, `found`

- The driver of our instincts is the brainstem -- the region at the very base of your brain, just above the spinal chord. Scientists have known for some time that another brain region, the prefrontal cortex, plays a role in keeping those instincts in check

- Gross and colleagues have literally found the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem.

- went on to confirm that this physical connection was the brake that inhibits instinctive behavior. They found that in mice that have been repeatedly defeated by another mouse -- the murine equivalent to being bullied -- this connection weakens, and the mice act more scared. The scientists found that they could elicit those same fearful behaviors in mice that had never been bullied, simply by using drugs to block the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem

- found that the connection from the prefrontal cortex is to a very specific region of the brainstem, called the PAG, which is responsible for the acting out of our instincts. However, it doesn't affect the hypothalamus, the region that controls feelings and emotions

- So the prefrontal cortex keeps behavior in check, but doesn't affect the underlying instinctive feeling: it stops you from running off-stage, but doesn't abate the butterflies in your stomach

- Tactile performance was assessed using the so-called "two-point discrimination threshold." This marker indicates how far apart two stimuli need to be, to be discriminated as two separate sensations -- the closer they are, the better the sense of touch.

- The placebo group improved their tactile acuity, as expected, by about 15 percent. In contrast, the cortisol given to the other group blocked almost all the stimulation-induced improvement.

- In previous studies on a cellular level, neuroscientists have demonstrated that cortisol suppresses the strengthening of synaptic connections, and therefore the plasticity of the brain -- its ability to learn.

- The entorhinal cortex could be a new system for memory formation that works in parallel to the hippocampus

- When a spatial memory is formed, cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), especially grid cells, act like a navigational system. They provide the hippocampus with information on where an animal is and give cues as to how far and in what direction the animal has moved

- During both sleep and waking periods, the sMEC triggers its own replay and initiates recall and consolidation independent of the hippocampus

**Gist: Perhaps due to brain hemisphere specialization, mammal infants like to position themselves on the left of their mothers, so as to better keep track of her. However, if a threat emerges, the positions reverse so the mother can better keep track of child.**

-  it seems many mammal babies prefer to approach their mother from one side too – and the explanation may lie in the contrasting talents of each half of the brain

- Some researchers think this explains why human and ape mothers tend to cradle their babies on the left: it is so they can better monitor their facial expressions with their left eye.

- Infants of all species were more likely to position themselves so that their mother was on their left. This happened about three-quarters of the time.

- found that mammal infants who keep their mother on their left are better able to keep track of her and hence increase their chance of survival

- However, if a threat emerges, the roles often reverse, Ingram says. “Infants keep their mother on their left in normal situations such as moving forward or suckling,” she says. “But when faced with stressful situations such as when fleeing, mothers prefer their infant on their left side so they can better monitor them.”

- False memory was discovered in an experiment that asked volunteers to memorise lists of related words and then recall them. When they learned “bed”, “drowsy” and “dream”, about half later also remembered the word “sleep”. 

- well-rested brains normally use “associative memory” to link related concepts together. “There’s a lot of evidence that the brain cares less about individual data and more about the gist of it or what it means,”

- They asked 44 people to memorise lists of words when they were well rested, had slept for only four hours on each of the previous four nights, or hadn’t slept at all for the past 30 hours.

- Unsurprisingly, when they were immediately asked to recall these words, the volunteers did less well when partially or completely sleep-deprived. But when shown a new list and asked which ones had been on the original list, sleep-deprived people were less likely to misremember

- This shows that not only were they less able to learn individual items, they were also less able to extract their meaning.

- "Every time you move your eye, the whole world moves on your retina," says Gaby Maimon, head of the Laboratory of Integrative Brain Function. "But you don't perceive an earthquake happening several times a second."

- the brain can tell if visual motion is self-generated, canceling out information that would otherwise make us feel -- and act -- as if the world was whirling around us.

- Each time you shift your gaze (and you do so several times a second), the brain sends a command to the eyes to move. But a copy of that command is issued internally to the brain's own visual system, as well.

- the common fruit fly performs the same kinds of rapid eye movements. The mere 100,000 neurons in its poppy-seed sized brain must therefore handle the same problems of prediction and perception

- During intentional turns, each neuron received a signal that was carefully calibrated to suppress sensitivity to visual motion along the yaw axis alone

- eye contact is one of the most important forms of nonverbal communication

- Human eyes, with their large unpigmented areas, turn out to be great for deducing where someone is looking. This likely makes it all the easier to track someone’s attention

- A recent experiment conducted in Japan suggests that eye contact draws on the same mental resources used for complex tasks, so trying to maintain eye contact can impede your reasoning. In this case, the break in eye contact comes not from emotion, but from the need to preserve cognitive resources. Eye contact can deplete your mental bandwidth.

- Eye contact is something we prefer from birth, but it is not advantageous in every situation. Back in 1998, researchers theorized that averting the gaze from surroundings aids thinking by disengaging from potential distractions around us.

- participants themselves were more likely to choose to express disgust when their goal was to show that their condemnation of an act was morally motivated, while they chose to express anger when they sought to protest that the act harmed their own interests.

- The findings suggest that disgust is not just an expression of an inner feeling, like nausea or contamination, but a signal that advertises a moral position.

- Using LED lights flickering at a specific frequency, researchers have shown that they can significantly reduce the beta amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease in the visual cortex of mice. This treatment appears to work by stimulating brain waves known as gamma oscillations, which the researchers discovered help the brain suppress beta amyloid production and invigorate cells responsible for destroying the plaques.

- It's a big 'if,' because so many things have been shown to work in mice, only to fail in humans

- Previous studies have hinted that Alzheimer's patients also have impaired gamma oscillations. These brain waves, which range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per second), are believed to contribute to normal brain functions such as attention, perception, and memory.

- After an hour of stimulation at 40 hertz, the researchers found a 40 to 50 percent reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus

- after gamma stimulation, the process for beta amyloid generation is less active

`consolidated`, `memories`, `brain`, `stimuli`, `experience`, `slugs`, `inhibits`, `awakening`

- During consolidation, the brain produces new proteins that strengthen fragile memory traces. However, if a new experience occurs while an existing memory trace is being consolidated, the new stimuli could disrupt the consolidation process

- How does the brain prevent events that occur just after awakening from interrupting the consolidation process?

- The brain partially solves this problem by postponing some of the memory consolidation to a period in which new experiences are minimalized, that is, while we are asleep.

- exposing sea slugs to new stimuli immediately after they wake up does not trigger the formation of new memories

- On awakening, interactions between new experiences and consolidation are prevented because the brain blocks long-term memory arising from the new stimuli. However, when the researchers treated the slugs just prior to the training with a drug that inhibits protein production, they found that the new stimuli could generate long-term memory.

- The major insight from this research is that there is an active process in the brain which inhibits the ability to learn new things and protects the consolidation of memories.

**Gist: Sleep spindle oscillations, associated with memory consolidation, move around each side of the brain in Princess Leia waves -- resembling twin hair buns.**

- Every night while you sleep, electrical waves of brain activity circle around each side of your brain, tracing a pattern that, were it on the surface of your head, might look like the twin hair buns of Star Wars' Princess Leia.

- The scale and speed of Princess Leia waves in the cortex is unprecedented, a discovery that advances the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative

- Sleep spindles -- a type of brain wave pattern known to occur in the earliest stages of non-REM sleep -- are associated with memory consolidation. Previous studies showed that the more sleep spindles a human brain exhibits overnight, the more numbers one would remember the next day

- Scientists had long believed that each sleep spindle oscillation peaked at the same time everywhere in the neocortex of the brain

- the sleep spindles weren't peaking simultaneously everywhere in the cortex. Instead, the oscillations were sweeping in circular patterns around and around the neocortex, peaking in one area, and then -- a few milliseconds later -- an adjacent area

- The time scale that these waves travel at is the same speed it takes for neurons to communicate with each other.

- As a memory is being consolidated, Muller and Sejnowski hypothesize, circular sleep spindle waves help form the links between these different aspects of a single memory.

- Such “deep brain stimulation” (DBS) works miracles on people with otherwise untreatable epilepsy or Parkinson’s disease – but drilling into someone’s head is an extreme step. In future, we may be able to get the same effects by using stimulators placed outside the head

- The technique, unveiled at the Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego, California, this week, places two electrical fields of different frequencies outside the head. The brain tissue where the fields overlap is stimulated, while the tissue under just one field is unaffected because the frequencies are too high

- one field at 10,000 hertz and another at 10,010 hertz. The affected nerve cells are stimulated at 10 hertz – the difference between the two frequencies

- Anhedonic people do not have problems correctly perceiving and processing the information contained in a melody (such as intervals or rhythms) and present a normal pleasure response to other pleasant stimuli

- the decrease of pleasant response to music shown by participants with musical anhedonia is related to a reduction in the activity of the nucleus accumbens, a key subcortical structure of the reward system

- transposons, small regions of DNA that can move themselves from one part of the genome to another during the lifetime of a cell

- When they move around, they may create mutations in or alter the activity of a functional gene; transposons can therefore create new genetic profiles in a population for natural selection to act on, in either a positive or negative way.

- two types of transposons, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), have a competitive relationship with one another. In order to replicate, SINEs steal the molecular machinery that LINEs use to copy themselves

- predicted that populations of LINE and SINE elements in the genome are expected to oscillate the way those of, for example, wolves and rabbits might

- these oscillations occur over a timescale that is longer than the human lifespan—waves of Alu elements and L1 elements pushing and pulling at each other in slow motion across generations of the human genomes that carry them

- the study showed new protein synthesis in a specific sub-region of the prefrontal cortex known in rodents as the prelimbic. In humans, this area corresponds to the anterior cortex

- when they closely examined the effects on the brain of conditioning rodents with a mild foot shock, the scientists found several messenger RNAs recruited to polyribosomes in the medial prefrontal cortex -- a clear indication of new protein synthesis there

- if they inhibited new protein synthesis in the prelimbic region right after fear conditioning took place, those memories did not form. But if the researchers waited just a few hours, inhibiting protein synthesis in prelimbic cortex had no impact and the memories took hold

- It may be that the first wave of protein synthesis is critical for encoding contextual fear memory, while second wave in other sub-regions is important for memory storage

**Gist: The hippocampal CA3 region, critical for learning and memory, retrieves memories using pattern completion, enabled by a sparse (1%), small-world type architecture.**

- The hippocampal CA3 region plays a key role in learning and memory. One of the most remarkable properties of the network is its ability to retrieve previously stored memories from incomplete or degraded versions, a phenomenon that is widely known as pattern completion.

- It is generally accepted that the synapses between CA3 pyramidal cells, the recurrent CA3-CA3 synapses, play a key role in pattern completion, but how this exactly works has remained enigmatic.

- Previous theories of the hippocampal formation often depicted the CA3 region as a network of highly interconnected cells.

- they found that connectivity was sparse, with an average connection probability of approximately 1%

- Even more surprisingly, they discovered that connectivity in the network is not random, but exhibits connectivity motifs that occur much more frequently than expected for a random network. Thus, the structure of the hippocampal CA3 network may be somewhat reminiscent of a "small world" architecture as found in social networks.

- synaptic connections between two cells are mediated by only one or two synaptic contacts. This is also remarkable because much higher numbers have been found for excitatory synaptic connections in the neocortex

- the design of synaptic connections based on one or two synaptic contacts also seems useful for pattern completion, apparently because it minimizes redundancy in the flow of information in the network. Thus, both macro- (e.g. motifs) and microconnectivity (e.g. properties of connection) facilitate pattern completion in the CA3 cell network.

- But these dictator cells aren’t the whole story. Crayfish can trigger a tail-flip another way too – via another small set of neurons that effectively act as an oligarchy.

- For many other behaviors, however, nervous systems make decisions through something like Sherrington’s “million-fold democracy.”

- Unlike countries, however, nervous systems can implement multiple forms of government simultaneously. A neuronal dictatorship can coexist with an oligarchy or democracy. The dictator, acting fastest, may trigger the onset of a behavior while other neurons fine-tune the ensuing movements.

- piquing people's curiosity can influence their choices by steering them away from tempting desires, like unhealthy foods or taking the elevator, and toward less tempting, but healthier options, such as buying more fresh produce or taking the stairs

- In the first experiment, the researchers approached 200 people in a university library and gave them a choice between two fortune cookies, one plain and one dipped in chocolate and covered in sprinkles

- Participants whose curiosity was piqued (i.e., were told the plain cookie contained a fortune specifically about them) overwhelmingly chose the plain cookie by 71 percent. In contrast, when participants were told nothing, 80 percent chose the chocolate-dipped cookie.

- researchers were able to increase the use of the stairs in a university building nearly 10 percent by posting trivia questions near the elevators and promising the answers in the stairwell.

- The strategies employed in these experiments and field studies are similar to those used by websites that attempt to increase traffic with sensationalized headlines

- They could've been merely byproducts of other brain processes that enabled what we learn to be stored as a memory. But our study shows that, indeed, the spindles are crucial for the process of creating memories we need for every-day life. And we can target them to enhance memory

- During sleep one of the nights, each person received tACS -- an alternating current of weak electricity synchronized with the brain's natural sleep spindles

- Frohlich's team found no improvement in test scores for associative word-pairing but a significant improvement in the motor tasks when comparing the results between the stimulation and placebo night

- Exaggerating the visual appearance of mistakes could help people further improve their motor skills after an initial performance peak

- healthy participants learned a virtual tetherball-like game in which they tried to hit a target with a ball hanging from a pole. After three days, all players reached a performance plateau. Then, for some players, the researchers secretly manipulated the game so that the distance by which the ball missed the target appeared bigger on screen than it actually was

- Participants whose mistakes appeared at least twice as bad as they really were broke past their plateau and continued sharpening their tetherball skills. A control group that remained undeceived showed negligible improvement

- error exaggeration did not change how they made corrections in their throwing techniques. Instead, it reduced random fluctuations, or noise, in nervous system signals that control muscle movement. These findings challenge existing assumptions that such noise cannot be reduced

- The homeostat measures something -- and we don't know what that something is -- that happens in our brains while we are awake, and when that something hits a certain ceiling, we go to sleep. The system is reset during sleep, and the cycle begins anew when we wake up.

`neurons`, `memories`, `excitability`, `engram`, `brain`, `mice`, `memories trace`, `brain cells`

- When two events happen in short succession, they feel somehow linked to each other. It turns out that apparent link has a physical manifestation in our brains

- In your brain, and in the brains of lab mice, recollections are physically represented as collections of neurons with strengthened connections to one another. These clusters of connected cells are known as engrams, or memory traces.

- more excitable neurons—that is, brain cells that activate easily—are more likely to be recruited into an engram, so if you increase the excitability of particular neurons, you can preferentially include them in a new engram.

- Neurons in a newly formed memory trace are subsequently more excitable than neighboring brain cells for a transient period of time. It follows then that a memory formed soon after the first might be encoded in an overlapping population of neurons

- Mice should normally form separate memories when events happen 24 hours apart, but when the researchers re-excited the neurons in the first memory engram while the second memory was forming, they could artificially link those experiences

- Decreasing the excitability of the neurons in the first memory during the second event seemed to prevent the second memory from forming.

**Gist: Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein, which supports growth and differentiation of neurons and synapses and is especially active in areas of the brain vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking, is enhanced by environmental enrichment, leading to improved performance on learning and memory tasks.**

- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, also known as BDNF, is a protein[1] that, in humans, is encoded by the BDNF gene.[2][3] BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical Nerve Growth Factor. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery.

- BDNF acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.[4][5] In the brain, it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking

- BDNF expression is significantly enhanced by environmental enrichment and appears to be the primary source of environmental enrichments ability to enhance cognitive processes. Environmental enrichment enhances synaptogenesis, dendridogenesis, and neurogenesis, leading to improved performance on various learning and memory tasks.

- A team of researchers, led by Daniel Levitin of McGill University, has found after analyzing over two thousand pieces of classical music that span four hundred years of history, that virtually all of them follow a one-over-f (1/f) power distribution equation

- One-over-f equations describe the relative frequency of things that happen over time and can be used to describe such naturally occurring events as annual river flooding or the beating of a human heart. They have been used to describe the way pitch is used in music as well, but until now, no one has thought to test the idea that they could be used to describe the rhythm of the music too.

- by adding another variable to the equation, called a beta, which was used to describe just how predictable a given piece was compared to other pieces, they could solve for beta and find a unique number of for each composer.

- A 2003 study, cited in a meta-analysis by Henry L. Roediger III and Jeffrey D. Karpicke, highlights the power of testing for making information stick.

- In the study, researchers led by Mark Wheeler had participants either review a list of 40 words five times or review it once and take four recall tests. Then they took a recall test either 5 minutes or one week later.

- participants who'd read the word list five times performed much better on the recall test five minutes later. But participants who'd read the test just once and been tested performed better on the test one week later.

- More recent research suggests that combining testing with immediate feedback (finding out whether you answered right or wrong) is more effective, and can even boost memory right after the information is learned.

- these studies suggest that the most efficient strategy for remembering something - whether you're learning a new language or studying for a science exam - is simply to practice recalling it.

- Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum

**Gist: Pairing stimuli with positive emotions (reward) improves memory for similar future stimuli (even if no reward), but only after sleeping first.**

- Combining a positive emotional component with a given stimulus promotes memory for future stimuli of the same type

- Our brain, quoting Javiera Oyarzún, first author of the study, "works as a sorting machine. Every time we expose ourselves to a stimulus, our brain sorts it out in a category, such as people, animals, objects, etc. This way, whenever we receive new information we can integrate it with similar available information thanks to our ability to generalize

- we usually do not remember the details surrounding our usual way back home, but if during that time we receive a phone call with good news, or we witness a car accident, we will remember those details with much more precision

- we designed a study with volunteers who were shown a series of images corresponding to two categories (objects and animals), but were only rewarded by one of these categories

- As expected, participants remembered those images associated with a reward better

- In a second session, however, they were shown new images of animals and objects, but knowing that this time there would be no reward. "What we saw is that participants not only remembered "rewarding" images better, but also those of the same semantic category despite knowing that they were not associated with any reward,"

- One of the most significant aspects of the published work is that the effects of emotionally positive stimuli on memory storage are not observed until after 24 hours, ie, it is necessary that the participant sleeps.

`face`, `gender`, `gender blended`, `asked`, `categorise`, `feminine`, `prefer`, `less appealing`

- the 'Johnny Depp Effect' -- which involves women tending to prefer men with more feminine faces -- holds in some contexts, but not in others

- when people are asked to rate the attractiveness of gender-blended face morphs they tend to judge them as less appealing if they are first asked to classify the face as male or female

- gender blends were disliked when, and only when, the faces were first categorised by gender, despite an overall preference of the participants for more feminine features

- In the second experiment, in which some participants were first asked to categorise gender-ambiguous faces by ethnicity, they did not subsequently judge the gender blends as less appealing.

- mental effort of having to assign a gender to an ambiguous face has a flow-on effect of negatively influencing how we feel about that face

`neurons`, `brains`, `bird`, `primate`, `connect`, `previously`, `small`, `grow`

- The first study to systematically measure the number of neurons in the brains of birds has found that they have significantly more neurons packed into their small brains than are stuffed into mammalian and even primate brains of the same mass.

- studies found that the birds could manufacture and use tools, use insight to solve problems, make inferences about cause-effect relationships, recognize themselves in a mirror and plan for future needs, among other cognitive skills previously considered the exclusive domain of primates

- Birds can perform these complex behaviors because birds' forebrains contain a lot more neurons than any one had previously thought -- as many as in mid-sized primates

- Previously, neuroanatomists thought that as brains grew larger neurons had to grow bigger as well because they had to connect over longer distances. "But bird brains show that there are other ways to add neurons: keep most neurons small and locally connected and only allow a small percentage to grow large enough to make the longer connections.

`memories`, `main route`, `consequence`, `learned`, `associating`, `mice`, `connections`, `scientists`

- Gross and colleagues studied the hippocampus, a region of the brain that's long been known to help form memories. Information enters this part of the brain through three different routes. As memories are cemented, connections between neurons along the 'main' route become stronger.

- When they blocked this main route, the scientists found that the mice were no longer capable of learning a Pavlovian response -- associating a sound to a consequence, and anticipating that consequence. But if the mice had learned that association before the scientists stopped information flow in that main route, they could still retrieve that memory

- blocking that main route had an unexpected consequence: the connections along it were weakened, meaning the memory was being erased

- this active push for forgetting only happens in learning situations

- For example, the human brain has separate areas for motor control and tactile processing, and each of these areas consist of sub-regions that govern different parts of the body

- this paper suggest that hierarchy evolves not because it produces more efficient networks, but instead because hierarchically wired networks have fewer connections

- Located behind the eyes, the orbitofrontal cortex plays a key role in decision-making and, when damaged, can lead to poor choices and impulsivity.

- The more the monkey needed to think about the options, particularly when there was not much difference between the amounts of juice offered, the more the neural patterns would switch back and forth.

- research suggests that there is an "atomic" unit of recognition -- a minimum amount of information an image must contain for recognition to occur

- When the scientists compared the scores of the human subjects with those of the computer models, they found that humans were much better at identifying partial- or low-resolution images

- Almost all the human participants were successful at identifying the objects in the various images, up to a fairly high loss of detail -- after which, nearly everyone stumbled at the exact same point. The division was so sharp, the scientists termed it a "phase transition." "If an already minimal image loses just a minute amount of detail, everybody suddenly loses the ability to identify the object," says Ullman. "That hints that no matter what our life experience or training, object recognition is hardwired and works the same in all of us."

- A new equation, showing how our happiness depends not only on what happens to us but also how this compares to other people, has been developed by UCL researchers funded by Wellcome

- found that inequality reduced happiness on average. This was true whether people were doing better or worse than another person they had just met

- On average, when someone won a gamble they were happier when their partner also won the same gamble compared to when their partner lost. This difference could be attributed to guilt. Similarly, when people lost a gamble they were happier when their partner also lost compared to when their partner won, a difference that could be attributed to envy.

- The people who gave away half of their money when they had the opportunity showed no envy when they experienced inequality in a different task but showed a lot of guilt. By contrast, those who kept all the money for themselves displayed no signs of guilt in the other task but displayed a lot of envy

- The task may prove to be a useful way of measuring empathy, which could offer insight into social disorders such as borderline personality disorder

- These results were obtained using functional MRI on university students specializing in mathematics and other disciplines

- When they were thinking about mathematical subjects, a dorsal frontoparietal network of the brain was activated, a network which showed no overlap with the language regions

- Most mathematicians and physicists believe instead that mathematical thought is independent of languages, such as Albert Einstein who said that, "The words of language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought.

Instead short trees are thin and tall ones thick. Even more, thicker trees have larger defects, such as knots, where stress concentrates when a tree bends.

- Another instance where photo-taking did not appear to increase enjoyment was when taking photos interfered with the experience itself, such as having to handle bulky and unwieldy camera equipment.

- In one instance, participants went on a virtual safari and observed a pride of lions attacking a water buffalo, a sight most people found aversive. Photo-takers in that instance reported lower levels of enjoyment than those who saw the same encounter but did not take photos

- the process of actively wiping memories happens when brain cells remove AMPA receptors from the connections between brain cells

- Over time, if the memory is not recalled, the AMPA receptors may fall in number and the memory is gradually erased.

`memories`, `neurons`, `anti memories`, `brain`, `store`, `excitatory`, `inhibitory`, `balanced`

- what regulates our ability to store and recall information? New research suggests one of the processes involved is 'anti-memories' – connections between neurons that generate the exact opposite pattern of electrical activity to that of the original memory

- The 'anti-memories' hypothesis comes back to the idea that healthy brain function results from the interaction between two types of brain cells: excitatory and inhibitory neurons

- without this balancing of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) functions, overly excited neurons could give rise to conditions like epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism

- memories are stored in balanced E/I cortical ensembles

- anti-memories "appear to allow multiple memories to be stored in the brain, without interference between these memories"

`cortex`, `brain`, `memory`, `hippocampus`, `slow oscillations`, `sleep`, `synaptic`, `wave ripples`

- How the brain consolidates memory during deep sleep

- Using a computational model, study explains how hippocampus influences synaptic connections in cortex

- During sleep, human and animal brains are primarily decoupled from sensory input. Nevertheless, the brain remains highly active, showing electrical activity in the form of sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (a small region of the brain that forms part of the limbic system) and large-amplitude slow oscillations in the cortex (the outer layer of the cerebrum)

- Traces of episodic memory acquired during wakefulness and initially stored in the hippocampus are progressively transferred to the cortex as long-term memory during sleep

- patterns of slow oscillations in the cortex, which their model spontaneously generates, are influenced by the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and that these patterns of slow oscillations determine synaptic changes in the cortex

- During such memory replay, the corresponding synapses are strengthened for long-term storage in the cortex

- In mathematics, the G-function was introduced by Cornelis Simon Meijer (1936) as a very general function intended to include most of the known special functions as particular cases.

- A notable property is the closure of the set of all G-functions not only under differentiation but also under indefinite integration. In combination with a functional equation that allows to liberate from a G-function G(z) any factor zρ that is a constant power of its argument z, the closure implies that whenever a function is expressible as a G-function of a constant multiple of some constant power of the function argument, f(x) = G(cxγ), the derivative and the antiderivative of this function are expressible so too.

`holes`, `drilled`, `cube`, `6 cm`, `lattice`, `cell`, `density`, `critical`

- The scenario involves a wooden cube with 6-cm sides made of medium-density fiberboard. Each of the six faces is marked with a 6 x 6-cm square lattice for a total of 36 square cells per face. Then round holes (of diameter equal to the length of a square cell) are drilled through random cells all the way through the cube.

- the number of holes that needs to be drilled to collapse this particular cube is always around 13 holes in each of the three directions, or 39 holes total. Their formula shows that, although this critical number changes for different lattice sizes, the critical density of drills is very similar.

When light hits the spherical surface of the cell, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused internal spot, towards the source of the light, with the cells using tiny tentacle-like structures called pili to pull themselves forwards.

- Individuals addicted to cocaine may have difficulty in controlling their addiction because of a previously-unknown 'back door' into the brain, circumventing their self-control, suggests a new study.

- The basolateral amygdala stores the pleasurable memories associated with cocaine, but the pre-frontal cortex manipulates this information, helping an individual to weigh up whether or not to take the drug: if an addicted individual takes the drug, this activates mechanisms in the dorsal striatum

- The pathway links the basolateral amygdala indirectly with the dorsolateral striatum, circumventing the prefrontal cortex. This means that an addicted individual would not necessarily be aware of their desire to take the drug.

`pathological personality`, `traits`, `weeded`, `neurotic`, `impulsive`, `biases`, `confer`, `mates`

- people with certain extreme pathological personality traits fare well in the game of love

- Their results show that people with some pathological personality types, such as those considered neurotic and impulsive, had more mates and even more children than average, suggesting that such traits are not being weeded out by natural selection and actually may confer an evolutionary advantage

- there may be some biases in participants’ self-reports of relationship

- Cannabis increases the noise in your brain

- Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study shows that this active ingredient increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.
