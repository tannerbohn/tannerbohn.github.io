`light`, `sleep`, `exposure`, `oled`, `effect`, `energy metabolic`, `researchers`, `light exposure`

- Polychromatic white LEDs emit a large amount of blue light, which has been linked with many negative health effects, including metabolic health

- In contrast, OLEDs emit polychromatic white light that contains less blue light. However, the impact of LED and OLED exposure at night has not been compared in terms of changes in energy metabolism during sleep

- "Although no effect on sleep architecture was observed, energy expenditure and core body temperature during sleep were significantly decreased after OLED exposure. Furthermore, fat oxidation during sleep was significantly lower after exposure to LED compared with OLED."

- "Attention allows you to focus your resources on a particular stimulus, while a similar selection process happens with items in working memory," said Buschman. "Our results show the prefrontal cortex uses one representation to control both attention and working memory."

- "The brain is holding information in a way that the network can't see it," he said. Then, when it came time to respond at the end of the trial, the memory representation rotated

`subtract`, `away`, `ideas`, `adding`, `addition`, `might`, `reminded`, `brick`

- we usually try and solve problems by adding more, rather than taking away

- this preference for adding was noticeable in three scenarios in particular: when people were under higher cognitive load, when there was less time to consider the other options, and when volunteers didn't get a specific reminder that subtracting was an option

- Additive ideas come to mind quickly and easily, but subtractive ideas require more cognitive effort

- Our brains might find additive changes easier to process perhaps

- There might also be associations in our minds with the status quo being something that needs to be maintained as much as possible  and taking something away is arguably more destructive to the status quo than adding something new

- they could not find a link between the relative "concreteness" of a word's definition and its memorability. A word like "moth" was no more memorable than a word that has more abstract meanings, like "chief."

- more memorable words did not simply appear more often in sentences than the less memorable ones

- their results suggested that the more memorable words were more semantically similar, or more often linked to the meanings of other words used in the English language

- results supported the idea that the more memorable words represented high trafficked hubs in the brain's memory networks.

`object`, `infant`, `name`, `distinct`, `infant encode`, `memory`, `consistent`, `encode`

- the way an object is named guides infants' encoding, representation and memory for that object

- During training, all infants viewed four distinct objects from the same object category, each introduced in conjunction with either the same novel noun (Consistent Name condition), a distinct novel noun for each object (Distinct Names condition), or the same sine-wave tone sequence (Consistent Tone condition)

- When the same name is applied consistently to a set of objects, infants encode primarily their commonalties. In contrast, when a unique name is applied to each object, infants encode each object's unique features.

- Social rewards such as praise are known to enhance various stages of the learning process.

- found that praise delivered by artificial beings such as robots and virtual graphics-based agents can have effects similar to praise delivered by humans

- motor task performance in participants was significantly enhanced by praise from either one or two robots or virtual agents

- two agents led to significantly greater participant performance than one agent, even when the amount of praise was identical

- whether the praise was delivered by physical robots or by virtual agents did not influence the effects

`learn`, `shock`, `pain`, `participants`, `decision`, `another person`, `vmpfc`, `implicated`

- Humans are often motivated by self-interest. Participants in one study, for example, learned a game faster when they earned money for themselves as opposed to another person. However, this pattern changes when physical harm enters the equation.

- participants played an electric shock game. They chose between two abstract symbols: one had a high chance of delivering a non-painful electrical shock while the other had a low chance of delivering a painful shock

- participants were better at making optimal choices -- resulting in the least amount of pain -- when they chose for another person, rather than themselves. This could be explained by an increased sensitivity to the value of one choice over another

- Over the long-term, what one partner in a two-person relationship wishes to avoid, so too does the other partner -- and what one wants to achieve, so does the other.

- It was notable that the daily goals of one partner -- which can change -- mainly coincided with the medium- and longer-term goal trends of the other partner. It therefore takes several days to months for the long-term relationship goals of one partner to have an impact on the goals of the other. "This could be an adaptive mechanism to maintain the stability of the relationship," says Nikitin, "by not being influenced by every momentary shift made by the partner."

`brain`, `children`, `activated`, `learn`, `write`, `keyboard`, `van der meer`, `studies`

- choosing handwriting over keyboard use yields the best learning and memory

- Handwriting gives the brain more hooks to hang memories on

-  A lot of senses are activated by pressing the pen on paper, seeing the letters you write and hearing the sound you make while writing. These sense experiences create contact between different parts of the brain and open the brain up for learning

- In the debate about handwriting or keyboard use in school, some teachers believe that keyboards create less frustration for children. They point out that children can write longer texts earlier, and are more motivated to write because they experience greater mastery with a keyboard

- conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and even aggressive behaviors may be linked with sugar intake, and that it may have an evolutionary basis

- evidence that fructose, by lowering energy in cells, triggers a foraging response similar to what occurs in starvation

- a foraging response stimulates risk taking, impulsivity, novelty seeking, rapid decision making, and aggressiveness to aid the securing of food as a survival response. Overactivation of this process from excess sugar intake may cause impulsive behavior that could range from ADHD, to bipolar disorder or even aggression

`human`, `neuronal`, `memories`, `animal`, `difference`, `pattern separate`, `store`, `argues`

- It has previously been thought and copiously published that it is 'pattern separation' in the hippocampus, an area of the brain critical for memory, that enables memories to be stored by separate groups of neurons, so that memories don't get mixed up.

- when recording the activity of individual neurons we have found that there is an alternative model to pattern separation storing our memories

- the lack of pattern separation in memory coding is a key difference compared to other species, which has profound implications that could explain cognitive abilities uniquely developed in humans, such as our power of generalization and of creative thought

`stories`, `narrative`, `fiction`, `structure`, `language`, `storytellers`, `research`, `across`

- writers tend to set the stage at the beginning of stories with lots of prepositions and articles, which help to introduce and locate characters and settings

- As plots progress, the language changes, with the amount of auxiliary verbs, adverbs, and pronouns starting to increase, while a rise in words reflecting cognitive tension peaks over the course of the story, falling as the narrative proceeds to its conclusion.

- "From an evolutionary perspective, the structure of storytelling may provide a crucial way for people (or different groups) to share information... The optimal structure of storytelling, then, may originate from a natural inclination to first define objects/people and then assign action."

`auditory`, `human`, `brain`, `studied`, `pathway`, `language`, `evolutionary`, `fossil`

- demonstrated that exposing mice to light flickering or sound buzzing at 40Hz, a method dubbed "GENUS" for Gamma ENtrainment Using Sensory stimuli, strengthens the rhythm across the brain and changes the gene expression and activity of multiple brain cell types. Pathological amyloid and tau protein buildups decline, neurons and their circuit connections are protected from degeneration and learning and memory endure significantly better than in disease model mice who do not receive GENUS

- That GENUS extends to the hippocampus, which is key for memory, and the prefrontal cortex, which is key for cognition, is likely a factor in how it preserves brain function

- Across all cultures, people found smell the most difficult to talk about, reflecting the widely-held view that smell is the 'mute sense.' A traditional hunter-gatherer group from Australia, however, who speak the language Umpila, showed the best performance in talking about smell, outranking all other 19 cultures.

- speakers of Farsi and Lao, however, showed almost perfect scores in being able to identify taste

- The effect on self-concept and consequently on emotions is positive if a person is high-achieving, but the effect on self-concept and emotions is negative if the student is in a class of top performers. Correspondingly, it is good for a person's self-concept, and thus also for emotions, when the environment is less high-achieving

- There is also a reciprocal effect: Achievement influences emotions and emotions influence achievement. If positive emotions are reduced, achievements also diminish.

- a participant was shown three words (e.g., dress, dial, flower), with the requirement being to find a single associated word (in this case "sun")

- Researchers suggest this may be because music disrupts verbal working memory.

- exposure to music with familiar lyrics- impaired creativity regardless of whether the music also boosted mood, induced a positive mood, was liked by the participants, or whether participants typically studied in the presence of music

- demonstrate that music, regardless of the presence of semantic content (no lyrics, familiar lyrics or unfamiliar lyrics), consistently disrupts creative performance in insight problem solving

## :robot::sound: In a twist of the oft-used phrase, 'think globally, act locally', developing cortical circuits act locally to achieve global effects.

`activity`, `patterns`, `connections`, `network`, `visual`, `long range`, `correlated`, `spontaneous`

- One of the outstanding mysteries of the cerebral cortex is how individual neurons develop the proper synaptic connections to form large-scale, distributed networks

- gained novel insights from spontaneously generated patterns of activity by local networks in the early developing visual cortex. Apparently these form the basis for long-range neural connections that are established through brain activity over the course of cortical development

-  the spontaneous activity patterns were highly correlated between distant populations of neurons -- and in fact were so highly correlated that the activity of small populations of neurons could reliably predict coincident network activity patterns millimetres away

- By looking at the state of spontaneous activity patterns prior to eye opening, they expected to see a striking difference in the patterns of spontaneous activity because the long-range cortical connections that are thought to be the basis for distributed network activity patterns are absent in the immature cortex. To their surprise, they discovered robust long-range patterns of correlated spontaneous activity prior to eye opening, and found that they extended over distances comparable to what was seen in the mature brain.

- suggest that long-range order in the early developing cortex originates from neural activity driven by short-range connections

## :robot::sound: As soon as we have such a mental image, it is easy to put ourselves in the other person's place and to predict how they will behave."

`person`, `study`, `rotate`, `letter`, `mental rotate`, `mental`, `participants`, `eyes`

- focused on a mental rotation task commonly used in psychology, where participants are asked whether a rotated letter on computer screen is presented in its standard form (e.g. "R") or mirror-inverted form

- Usually, the more a letter is rotated away from the person judging it, the longer it takes to decide its form. The reason for this is that people first have to mentally rotate the object back to its upright orientation before being able to judge its form, and this rotation takes longer the more the letter is oriented away.

- the new study reveals that people can bypass this mental rotation when another person is introduced. The study shows that even when items are oriented away from participants, their decision times are surprisingly fast if the item appears upright to the other person and is therefore easily identifiable from their perspective. In contrast, if the letter appears upside down for the other person, even relatively easy judgements become harder for the participants

`extravert`, `extraversion`, `participants`, `week`, `lyubomirsky`, `behavior`, `study`, `act`

- For one week, the 123 participants were asked to -- in some cases -- push the boundaries of their willingness to engage, by acting as extraverts. For another week, the same group was asked to act like introverts.

- The findings suggest that changing one's social behavior is a realizable goal for many people, and that behaving in an extraverted way improves well-being

- Researchers next told participants -- both the Act Introvert group and the Act Extravert group -- that previous research found each set of behaviors are beneficial for college students.

- established a causal relationship between failure and future success

- in contrast to their initial expectations, that failure early in one's career leads to greater success in the long term for those who try again

- Researchers analyzed records of scientists who, early in their careers, applied for R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1990 and 2005. They utilized the NIH's evaluation scores to separate individuals into two groups: (1) the "near-misses" whose scores were just below the threshold that received funding and (2) the "just-made-its" whose scores were just above that threshold

- individuals in the near-miss group received less funding, but published just as many papers, and more hit papers, than individuals in the just-made-it group

- Further analysis revealed that while the attrition rate after failure was 10 percent higher for the near-miss group, that alone could not account for the greater success later in their careers

- Educators and educational scholars have long recognized that there is something of a "sweet spot" when it comes to learning. That is, we learn best when we are challenged to grasp something just outside the bounds of our existing knowledge. When a challenge is too simple, we don't learn anything new; likewise, we don't enhance our knowledge when a challenge is so difficult that we fail entirely or give up.

## :robot::sound: "You need to control the automatic process that makes you stop when muscles or joints hurt," Pessiglione says.

`fatigue`, `athletes`, `training`, `brain`, `researchers`, `pessiglione`, `control`, `studies`

- When researchers imposed an excessive training load on triathletes, they showed a form of mental fatigue. This fatigue included reduced activity in a portion of the brain important for making decisions. The athletes also acted more impulsively, opting for immediate rewards instead of bigger ones that would take longer to achieve.

- The lateral prefrontal region that was affected by sport-training overload was exactly the same that had been shown vulnerable to excessive cognitive work

- suggest a connection between mental and physical effort: both require cognitive control. The reason such control is essential in demanding athletic training, they suggest, is that to maintain physical effort and reach a distant goal requires cognitive control

`love`, `felt love`, `research`, `studies`, `data`, `psychological`, `experience`, `throughout`

- researchers found that people who experienced higher "felt love" -- brief experiences of love and connection in everyday life -- also had significantly higher levels of psychological well-being, which includes feelings of purpose and optimism

- Everyday felt love is conceptually much broader than romantic love. It's those micro-moments in your life when you experience resonance with someone. For example, if you're talking to a neighbor and they express concern for your well-being, then you might resonate with that and experience it as a feeling of love, and that might improve your well-being

- seen in the literature on mindfulness, when people are reminded to focus attention on positive things, their overall awareness of those positive things begins to rise

- There are these strategies for when collaborators don't have the same idea of what they want to happen, particularly if one collaborator is much higher status

- And if you're the songwriter in the room with them, you don't want to undermine that collaborator. You want to identify that they have something to bring to the table, and maybe it's their fame, but maybe it's not creativity. So what are the ways around that? How can you can still create something that is good, but not alienate or belittle your partner?

- The songwriters' responses indicated that most either try to take a backseat to the singer -- what Skaggs called "bespoke facilitation" -- or they come in with the songs mostly written -- "the manipulation dance."

`brain`, `activation`, `task`, `patterns`, `brain activation`, `shape`, `thalamus`, `dimensional manifold`

- It turns out that many structures in your brain work together in precise ways to coordinate their activity, shaping their actions to the requirements of whatever it is that you're trying to achieve.

- We call these coordinated patterns the "low-dimensional manifold", which you can think of as analogous to the major roadways that you use to commute to and from work. The majority of the traffic flows along these major highways, which represent an efficient and effective way to get from A to B.

- Our prediction was that performing the more difficult versions of the task would lead to a reconfiguration of the low-dimensional manifold. To return to the highway analogy, a tricky task might pull some brain activity off the highway and onto the back streets to help get around the congestion.

- More difficult trials showed different patterns of brain activation to easy ones, as if the brain's traffic was being rerouted along different roads

- Overall, these results suggests that our brain activity perhaps isn't as complicated as we once thought. Most of the time, our brain is directing traffic along pretty well-established routes, and even when it needs to get creative it is still trying to send the traffic to the same ultimate destination.

- This leaves us with an important question: how does the brain achieve this level of coordination?

- the circuitry of the thalamus is such that it can act as a filter for ongoing activity in the cerebral cortex, the brain's main information processing centre, and therefore could exert the kind of influence we were looking for

- when performing particular tasks, the thalamus helps to shape and constrain the activity in the cortex, a bit like a police officer directing busy traffic

- People of all ages tend to misjudge the strength of other people's emotions based on an egocentric bias

- Even if the end result is the same, the recipient of an action usually responds with stronger emotions if the actions are intentional rather than accidental

- if we accidentally harm someone else, we may wrongly assume that his/her feelings of sadness are weaker even if he/she is ignorant of our intention. Quarrels between children over trivial matters may also occur because of this sort of egocentric bias

- Pupils do better in spelling tests if teachers reward them for team -- rather than individual -- performance

- They suggest that a common goal of winning and an 'us versus them' mindset encourages higher-achieving pupils to help the weakest in their group do better. This team learning approach is preferable to rewarding just the best student in a class at the expense of others -- or pupils getting nothing at all. Besides showing improvements in their spelling scores, it was also found that these children became more prosocial.

`conscious`, `l5p neurons`, `brain`, `aru`, `stimulus`, `circuit`, `content`, `theory`

- No-one knows what connects awareness -- the state of consciousness -- with its contents, i.e. thoughts and experiences. Now researchers propose an elegant solution: a literal, structural connection

- 'Content circuits' within the cortex are plugged into 'switchboard circuits' that allocate awareness, says the theory, via cortical cells called L5p neurons

- Our conscious state is thought to depend on the activity of so-called 'thalamo-cortical' circuits. These are connections between neurons in the cortex, and neurons in the thalamus -- a thumb-sized relay center in the middle of the brain that controls information inflow from the senses (except smell)

- Thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits intersect via L5p neurons

- Functional brain studies suggest these cells may indeed couple the state and contents of consciousness

`critical`, `neuron`, `hengen`, `brain`, `record`, `active`, `research`, `network`

- Over the past 20 years, evidence mounted in support of a theory that the brain tunes itself to a point where it is as excitable as it can be without tipping into disorder, similar to a phase transition. This criticality hypothesis asserts that the brain is poised on the fine line between quiescence and chaos. At exactly this line, information processing is maximized

- When neurons combine, they actively seek out a critical regime

- We were surprised to find that, in our models, it was largely accounted for by a population of inhibitory neurons that, in retrospect, are well poised to regulate the organization of the larger network

- there's been quite a bit of argument about the math people use to measure criticality," Hengen said. "Recently, people moved away from measuring simple power laws, which can pop out of random noise, and have started looking at something called the exponent relation. So far, that's the only true signature of criticality, and it's the basis of all of our measurements."

`memories`, `brain`, `neuron`, `inform`, `active`, `task`, `networks`, `complex`

- Short-term memory is likely composed of many different processes, from very simple ones where you need to recall something you saw a few seconds ago, to more complex processes where you have to manipulate the information you are holding in memory

- during certain tasks that required information to be held in memory, their experiments found neural circuits to be unusually quiet. This led them to speculate that these "silent" memories might reside in temporary changes in the strength of connections, or synapses, between neurons

- called persistent neuronal activity, was especially evident during more complex, but still short-term, tasks. When a neuron gets an input, it generates a brief electrical spike in activity. Neurons form synapses with other neurons, and as one neuron fires it triggers a chain reaction to make another neuron fire

- during the silent periods of memory, the brain can use a short-term form of plasticity in the synaptic connections between neurons to remember information temporarily

- the goals elicited by movement affect decisions that need to be made immediately. So someone walking around a park is more likely to complete a deadline-driven purchase than someone sitting on a park bench contemplating life. But walking or sitting would not affect decisions about future purchases.

- What we found is that walking involves activating action representations that in turn promote other actions outside of the context of walking

- Likewise, sitting involves activating inaction representations that may promote inaction outside of the context of sitting

- "People are pleasantly surprised when a chatbot with low anthropomorphism -- fewer human cues -- has higher interactivity," said Sundar. "But when there are high anthropomorphic visual cues, it may set up your expectations for high interactivity -- and when the chatbot doesn't deliver that -- it may leave you disappointed."

- High interactivity is marked by swift responses that match a user's queries and feature a threaded exchange that can be followed easily, according to Sundar.

- improving interactivity may be more than enough to compensate for a less-humanlike chatbot. Even small changes in the dialogue, like acknowledging what the user said before providing a response, can make the chatbot seem more interactive

- propose a framework that organizes evidence-based self-control strategies along two dimensions based on how the strategies are implemented and who is initiating them.

- in some cases the best self-control strategy involves us changing the situation to create incentives or obstacles that help us exercise self-control, such as using apps that restrict our phone usage or keeping junk food out of the house

- In other cases it's more effective to change how we think about the situation -- for example, by making an if-then plan to anticipate how we'll deal with treats in the office -- so that exercising self-control becomes more appealing or easier to accomplish.

- Other strategies work better when someone else implements them for us. For example, our electricity company might use social norms to prompt a change in our thinking, showing us how our energy usage compares with that of our neighbors

- And policymakers often use situational constraints to prompt behavior focused on the long-term. Examples range from incentives (e.g., tax rebates for eco-friendly building materials) to penalties (e.g., raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol)

- The greatest surprises came from auditing the neuron's growth cones -- the outermost tips of the axonal tentacles, which develop into the signaling synapses. This portion contained much of the molecular machinery of an independent cell, including proteins involved in growth, metabolism, signaling and more

- What our results suggest is that growth cones are capable of taking in information from the outside world, making signaling decisions locally, and functioning semi-autonomously without the cell body

- Worse still, that alienating vibe makes sleep-deprived individuals more socially unattractive to others. Moreover, well-rested people feel lonely after just a brief encounter with a sleep-deprived person, potentially triggering a viral contagion of social isolation

- found newly-formed work teams experienced a 20 percent increase in productivity on subsequent tasks after playing video games together for just 45 minutes

- For their initial experimental task, each team played in a geocaching competition called Findamine, an exercise created by previous IS researchers which gives players short, text-based clues to find landmarks

- Following their first round of Findamine, teams were randomly assigned to one of three conditions before being sent out to geocache again: 1) team video gaming, 2) quiet homework time or 3) a "goal training" discussion on improving their geocaching results

- Each of these conditions lasted 45 minutes and those in the video gaming treatment chose to play either Rock Band or Halo 4 -- games selected because they are both familiar and require coordinated efforts among players.

- while the goal-training teams reported a higher increase in team cohesion than the video-gaming teams, the video gamers increased actual performance on their second round of Findamine significantly

- If team members are already familiar with each other, then competitive video gaming may possibly reinforce biases and negative relationships developed from previous experiences

The team of scientists suggests that our inner navigation system does much more. They propose that this system is also key to 'thinking', explaining why our knowledge seems to be organized in a spatial fashion

- The term 'cognitive spaces' refers to mental maps in which we arrange our experience.

- The very regular activation pattern of grid cells can also be observed in humans -- but importantly, not only during navigation through geographical spaces. Grids cells are also active when learning new concepts

- we came to the assumption that the brain stores a mental map, regardless of whether we are thinking about a real space or the space between dimensions of our thoughts. Our train of thought can be considered a path though the spaces of our thoughts, along different mental dimensions

`memories`, `spike`, `neurons`, `activation`, `miller`, `lundqvist`, `experiments`, `brain`

- tackle key questions about working memory such as, how we hold and juggle multiple pieces of information in mind

- The central issue of the debate is what happens after you hear or see what you need to remember and must then hold or control it in mind to apply it later. During that interim, or "delay period," do neurons in your brain's prefrontal cortex maintain it by persistently firing away, like an idling car engine, or do they spike in brief but coordinated bursts to store and retrieve information via the patterns of their connections, akin to how longer-term memory works?

- That neurons fire in short, cohesive bursts in accord with circuit-wide oscillations, makes functional sense, Miller and Lundqvist argue. It uses less energy than keeping neurons firing all the time, for example, and readily explains how multiple items can be held in mind simultaneously (distinct bursts representing different pieces of information can occur at different times). 

- "Storing information with a mixture of spiking and synapses gives the brain more flexibility," Lundqvist said. "It can juggle the activation of different memories, allowing the brain to hold multiple memories without them interfering with each other. Plus, synapses can store temporarily store memories while the spiking processes other thoughts.

`question`, `answer`, `learn`, `test`, `student`, `correct`, `butler`, `effect`

- Although people often think about multiple-choice tests as tools for assessment, they can also be used to facilitate learning

- The act of retrieving information strengthens memory for that information, leading to better long-term retention, and changes the representation of the information, creating deeper understanding

- Among key findings, educators should never include trick questions or offer "all of the above" or "none of the above" options among the list of possible answers

- While multiple-choice testing, especially repeated testing, has the potential to strengthen our recall, a poorly formatted test question can have the opposite effect

- Use three plausible response options. Question difficulty increases with each answer option offered. Students who correctly answer more difficult questions may learn more from rising to the challenge, but questions that offer too many plausible answers can have a negative effect on both learning and assessment

- Retrieving information and answering questions correctly reinforces student learning; failing to answer correctly may strengthen memories for misinformation. Challenge students, but allow them to succeed.

- Finally, because multiple choice questions expose students to lots of plausibly presented false information, it's important for students to review answers after grading is completed

- When 19 volunteers were given a choice of landscape images to print on a t-shirt or a mug, activity in these two brain areas increased as the number of options went up, according to readings from an fMRI machine. However, once the choice of pictures went above 12, activity started trailing off again.

- The equivalence principle, in simple terms, means that gravity accelerates all objects equally, as can be observed in the famous feather and hammer experiment

- It also means that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent

- Physicists have been debating whether the principle applies to quantum particles, so to translate it to the quantum world we needed to find out how quantum particles interact with gravity

- According to relativity, mass is held together by energy. But in quantum mechanics, that gets a bit complicated. A quantum particle can have two different energy states, with different numerical values, known as a superposition.
And because it has a superposition of energy states, it also has a superposition of inertial masses.

- found that for quantum particles in quantum superpositions of different masses, the principle implies additional restrictions that are not present for classical particles

- focused on a subtype of extremely large neurons in the NGC with links to virtually the entire nervous system, including the thalamus, where neurons can activate the entire cerebral cortex.

- NGC neurons were found to express the gene for an enzyme, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces nitric oxide, which in turn relaxes blood vessels, increasing the flow of oxygenated blood to tissue.

- (No other neurons in the brain are known to produce eNOS.) They also discovered that the eNOS-expressing NGC neurons are located close to blood vessels.

- "There is some low level of production when the animal is in a familiar setting," says Tabansky, "which is what you expect as they maintain arousal. But it is vastly increased when the animal is adapting to a new environment."

- Axons are not designed to minimize the use of cell tissue -- they wouldn't be so long and convoluted if that were the case. Conversely, they're not optimized for speed, as recent studies have shown that axons don't fire as fast as they physically could, since this would overwhelm the neuron and lead to a loss of network activity

- axons are designed and optimized to balance the speed that information flows into the neuron relative to the time it takes the neuron to process that information

- refraction ratio: it's the ratio between the refractory period of a neuron -- when the neuron is unable to process incoming signals since its ion channels are resetting after being flooded with sodium -- and the signal latency of information traveling down the axon. When that ratio approaches one, there is perfect balance, and the neuron is operating as efficiently as possible

- Learning in the cerebellum -- a part of the vertebrate brain located at the back of the skull that directs and regulates movements -- is guided through a process of trial and error

- Purkinje cells communicate through two types of electrical signals: simple spikes, which reflect information regarding the prediction that the cells are making, and complex spikes, which reflect information that is sent back to the Purkinje cells, informing them of the error in their prediction.

- You can think of the simple spikes as the 'student' that makes a prediction and the complex spikes as the 'teacher' that provides feedback

- Purkinje cells organize into small groups of about 50 and together make predictions, sending their output of all the members simultaneously. The neurons that make up these groups share a critical feature: They all receive the same error signal

- Regardless of how far off the monkeys' eyes were from the target, the number of complex spikes produced in the cerebellum stayed the same. Instead, they found that the direction of the error affected the probability of generating a complex spike, whereas the magnitude of the error affected the timing of the complex spike.

- Purkinje cells appear to be organized based on a preference for error in only a small part of the task space

- researchers revealed different emotional and cognitive modalities in our thoughts by identifying variations in language through tracking the use of specific words across the twitter sample which are associated with 73 psychometric indicators, and are used to help interpret information about our thinking style

- Although 73 different psychometric quantities were tracked, the team found there were just two independent underlying factors that explained most of the temporal variations across the data

- The first factor, with a peak expression time starting at around 5 am to 6 am, linked with measures of analytical thinking through the high use of nouns, articles and prepositions, which has been related, in other studies, to intelligence, improved class performance and education

- The second factor had a peak expression time starting at 3 am to 4 am, the aggregated twitter content found this time to be correlated with the language of existential concerns but anticorrelated with expression of positive emotions

- when we consider unknown future events, such as when we'll use a gift certificate, our relative and absolute time estimates tend to contradict each other

- the frame of mind we bring to the consideration -- whether we're thinking broadly and abstractly, or using more concrete, detail-oriented thinking -- influences which direction our relative and absolute time estimates will flow

- suggests that frames of mind can affect the urgency we bring to completing tasks and projects. For example, using an abstract attitude by thinking about why we should do something vs. how, may yield a greater sense of urgency to getting it done, even though the actual time when it will occur is further away

`replay`, `memories`, `lewis`, `rem`, `cortex`, `hippocampus`, `sleep`, `propose`

- proposes that non-REM sleep helps us organize information into useful categories, whereas REM helps us see beyond those categories to discover unexpected connections

- According to previous research, memories captured by the hippocampus are replayed during non-REM sleep, and as we detect similarities between them, that information gets stored in the cortex. Because the hippocampus and cortex are in close communication during this stage, Lewis and her co-authors propose that the hippocampus somehow controls what is replayed. Because it prefers to replay things that are similar or thematically linked, it encourages us to find those links and use them to form schemas, or organizing frameworks

- During REM sleep, on the other hand, the hippocampus and cortex don't appear to be nearly as in sync. So, Lewis's team suspects that the cortex is now free to replay stored memories in any combination, regardless of whether they are similar

- evidence suggests that ponto-geniculo-occipital waves cause areas of the cortex to randomly activate, which could trigger the replay of memories from different schemas

`breath`, `brain`, `focus`, `attention`, `meditation`, `practice`, `mind`, `study`

- research shows for the first time that breathing -- a key element of meditation and mindfulness practices -- directly affects the levels of a natural chemical messenger in the brain called noradrenaline

- When we are stressed we produce too much noradrenaline and we can't focus. When we feel sluggish, we produce too little and again, we can't focus. There is a sweet spot of noradrenaline in which our emotions, thinking and memory are much clearer

- as you breathe in locus coeruleus activity is increasing slightly, and as you breathe out it decreases. Put simply this means that our attention is influenced by our breath and that it rises and falls with the cycle of respiration. It is possible that by focusing on and regulating your breathing you can optimise your attention level and likewise, by focusing on your attention level, your breathing becomes more synchronised

- people who tended towards neuroticism paid more attention to the left side of a picture, and those with traits related to schizophrenia looked less often at the top of a picture

- we tend to look to the left side of images first and the fact that these individuals spent more time looking at the left overall suggests they find it harder to disengage their attention

Each sentence contained an expected or unexpected combination of an article and a noun (e.g., "The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a kite/an airplane")

- We saw that unexpected nouns generated an increased brain response compared to expected nouns. Just like the original study

- Even though 'a' and 'an' do not differ in their meaning, the 2005 study showed that unexpected articles also elicited an enhanced N400 response compared to expected articles

Research to date has been focused on the goings-on inside the boats, without much thought for the sea itself. But the new information suggests that the waves play a central role in how the complex brain coordinates itself and that the waves are directly linked to consciousness.

- These slowly varying signals in the brain are a way to get a very large-scale coordination of the activities in all the diverse areas of the brain

- found that the ultra-slow waves spontaneously started in a deep layer of mice's brains and spread in a predictable trajectory. As the waves passed through each area of the brain, they enhanced the electrical activity there. Neurons fired more enthusiastically when a wave was in the vicinity

- the ultra-slow waves persisted when the mice were put under general anesthesia, but with the direction of the waves reversed.

- In the study, 13 participants 60 and older received one night of acoustic stimulation and one night of sham stimulation. The sham stimulation procedure was identical to the acoustic one, but participants did not hear any noise during sleep. For both the sham and acoustic stimulation sessions, the individuals took a memory test at night and again the next morning. Recall ability after the sham stimulation generally improved on the morning test by a few percent. However, the average improvement was three times larger after pink-noise stimulation.

- Previous research showed acoustic simulation played during deep sleep could improve memory consolidation in young people

- The study used a new approach, which reads an individual's brain waves in real time and locks in the gentle sound stimulation during a precise moment of neuron communication during deep sleep, which varies for each person

`shape`, `sound`, `participants`, `word`, `kiki`, `research`, `hung`, `conscious aware`

- To participants' dominant eye, the researchers presented a series of flashing images; to the nondominant eye, they presented a target image that gradually faded in. Initially, participants were unaware of the target image and could only see the competing, flashing images

- the target image was always a nonsense word, bubu or kiki, inside of a shape. Sometimes the word (bubu) was congruent with the shape it was in (round) and sometimes it was incongruent with the shape (angular). The participants pressed a key whenever the target image became visible

- Timing data showed that the target image broke through to conscious awareness faster when it was congruent than when it was incongruent, indicating that participants perceived and processed the relationship between word and shape before they were consciously aware of the stimuli

`learned`, `environment`, `brain`, `metaplasticity`, `reward`, `synapses`, `learned rate`, `studies`

- there's not a single rate of learning for everything we do, as the brain can self-adjust its learning rates using a synaptic mechanism called metaplasticity

- One of the most complex problems in learning is how to adjust to uncertainty and the rapid changes that take place in the environment. It is very exciting to find that synapses, the simplest computational elements in the brain, can provide a robust solution for such challenges

- When things change frequently, a large learning rate is required but this reduces precision, whereas, a stable environment requires a small learning rate, which improves precision. The study illustrates how metaplasticity can mitigate the tradeoff between adaptability and precision in learning

- Increased letter spacing helps individuals read faster, but not due to visual processing, according to new research

- letter-spacing effect, which is this finding that both kids and adults with or without specific reading impairment read faster and more fluidly when you increase the spaces between letters in words

- Everybody seemed pretty certain up until this point that it was about decluttering your visual scene, which may make identifying letters easier," said Sacchi. "What my results show is that it doesn't look like the effect is happening early enough to be related to visual processing

- Increased spacing was very helpful for the words, and less helpful for the pseudo-words and the consonant strings. The fact that more "word-like" stimuli benefited more than less "word-like" stimuli suggests that the benefit is occurring during a reading-specific process, rather than during a purely visual stage

- In 2003, Saxe first showed that theory of mind is seated in a brain region known as the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). The TPJ coordinates with other regions, including several parts of the prefrontal cortex, to form a network that is active when people think about the mental states of others

`learn`, `brain`, `task`, `neuron`, `activity`, `research`, `change`, `carnegie mellon`

- the brain has various mechanisms and constraints by which it reorganizes its neural activity when learning over the course of a few hours. The new research finds that, when learning a new task, the brain is less flexible than previously thought

- When we're learning a new task, we can't instantaneously learn it to proficiency, in part due to the way in which the neurons are wired up in the brain. Learning takes time, and there are mechanisms by which neurons can change the way they communicate with each other to enable learning -- some of which can be fast, and some of which can take longer.

- When we learn, at first the brain tends to not produce new activity patterns, but to repurpose the activity patterns it already knows how to generate

- By repurposing neuron patterns the brain is already capable of generating, the brain applies a "quick and dirty fix" to the new problem it's facing

- despite Broca's area being one of the most studied human brain regions, neuroscientists are still not exactly sure what the same region does, on the other side of the brain

- Theory suggests the right hemisphere equivalent, or homologue, of Broca's area plays a similar role but for the processing of music instead of language

- Speech interaction experiments between adult dogs and humans showed that so called "dog-speak" improves attention and may help humans to socially bond with their pets

- A special speech register, known as infant-directed speech, is thought to aid language acquisition and improve the way a human baby bonds with an adult

- found that adult dogs were more likely to want to interact and spend time with the speaker that used dog-directed speech with dog-related content, than they did those that used adult-directed speech with no dog-related content

- When we mixed-up the two types of speech and content, the dogs showed no preference for one speaker over the other. This suggests that adult dogs need to hear dog-relevant words spoken in a high-pitched emotional voice in order to find it relevant.

For instance, the word 'face' originally meant the front part of a head, but over time it also came to mean the front part of other objects, such as the 'face' of the cliff, and an emotional state, such as putting on a brave 'face.'

- identified an algorithm called "nearest-neighbor chaining" as the mechanism that best describes how word senses accumulate over time

- findings suggest that word senses emerge in ways that minimize cognitive costs, which are the collective costs of generating, interpreting and learning word senses. In other words, new word senses emerge through an efficient mechanism that expresses new ideas via a compact set of words

- Over the past millennium, word senses have largely evolved from literal domains to metaphorical domains -- called metaphorical mapping

- To test if human brains actually compute the similarity between words as we listen to speech, the researchers recorded electrical brainwave signals recorded from the human scalp -- a technique known as electroencephalography or EEG -- as participants listened to a number of audiobooks

- by analysing their brain activity, they identified a specific brain response that reflected how similar or different a given word was from the words that preceded it in the story

- The longer staring bouts of dogs, which lasted an average of 40 seconds (compared with just three seconds for dingoes and less than a second for wolves), may be required to kick-start the oxytocin response in humans

`neuron`, `predict`, `theories`, `previous`, `code`, `framework`, `encode`, `signal`

- One of the main goals of sensory neuroscience is to predict neural responses using mathematical models. Previously, these predictions were based on three main theories, each of which had a different area of applicability, corresponding to varying assumptions about the neurons' internal constraints, the type of signal, and the purpose of the gathered information

- a neural code is essentially a function that predicts when a neuron should "fire,"

- Efficient coding assumes that the neurons encode as much information as possible, given their internal constraints (noise, metabolism, etc.).

- Predictive coding, on the other hand, assumes that only the information relevant to predicting the future (e.g. which way an insect will fly) is encoded

- sparse coding assumes that only a few neurons are active at any one time

- In the context of the team's framework, a neural code can be interpreted as the code that maximizes a certain mathematical function. This function -- and thus, the neural code maximizing it -- depends on three parameters: the noise in the signal, the goal or task (i.e. if the signal will be used to predict the future), and the complexity of the signal being encoded

- mood in young adults (18-29) seems to be dependent on food that increases availability of neurotransmitter precursors and concentrations in the brain (meat).

- However, mood in mature adults (over 30 years) may be more reliant on food that increases availability of antioxidants (fruits) and abstinence of food that inappropriately activates the sympathetic nervous system (coffee, high glycemic index and skipping breakfast)

- Regular consumption of meat leads to build-up of two brain chemicals (serotonin and dopamine) known to promote mood. Regular exercise leads to build-up of these and other neurotransmitters as well

- all regions of the human brain have molecular signatures very similar to those of our primate relatives, yet some regions contain distinctly human patterns of gene activity that mark the brain's evolution and may contribute to our cognitive abilities

- there are also distinct small differences between the species in how individual cells function and form connections

- the one area of the brain with the most human-specific gene expression is the striatum, a region most commonly associated with movement

- found one gene, ZP2, was active in only human cerebellum -- a surprise, said the researchers, because the same gene had been linked to sperm selection by human ova

- also focused on one gene, TH, which is involved in the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial to higher-order function and depleted in people living with Parkinson's disease. They found that TH was highly expressed in human neocortex and striatum but absent from the neocortex of chimpanzees

- discovered that the fruit fly brain has an elegant and efficient method of performing similarity searches

- it helps them identify odors that are most similar to those they've encountered before, so they know how to behave in response to the odor

- when fruit flies first sense an odor, 50 neurons fire in a combination that's unique to that smell. But rather than hashing that information by reducing the number of hashes associated with the odor, as computer programs would, flies do the opposite -- they expand the dimension

- The 50 initial neurons lead to 2,000 neurons, spreading out the input so that each smell has an even more distinct fingerprint among those 2,000 neurons. The brain then stores only the 5 percent of those 2,000 neurons with the top activity as the "hash" for that odor. The whole paradigm helps the brain notice similarities better than it would compared to reducing the dimension

- When they applied the process to three standard datasets computer scientists use to test search algorithms, they found that the fly approach improved performance

- Two brain regions -- the medial frontal and lateral prefrontal cortices -- control most executive function. Researchers used high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) to synchronize oscillations between them, improving brain processing. De-synchronizing did the opposite

- medial frontal cortex the "alarm bell of the brain."

- "If you make an error, this brain area fires," says Reinhart, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University. "If I tell you that you make an error, it also fires. If something surprises you, it fires."

-  this region of the brain works hand in hand (or perhaps lobe in lobe) with a nearby region, the lateral prefrontal cortex, an area that stores rules and goals and also plays an important role in changing our decisions and actions

- Research has recently suggested that populations of millions of cells in the medial frontal cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex may communicate with each other through the precise timing of their synchronized oscillations, and these brain rhythms appear to occur at a relatively low frequency (about four to eight cycles per second)

- Our new theory thinks about navigation as part of the more general problem of computing plans that maximise future reward

- The key computational idea we drew on is that to estimate future reward, an agent must first estimate how much immediate reward it expects to receive in each state, and then weight this expected reward by how often it expects to visit that state in the future. By summing up this weighted reward across all possible states, the agent obtains an estimate of future reward

- we argue that the hippocampus represents every situation - or state - in terms of the future states which it predicts

- By representing each current state in terms of its anticipated successor states, the hippocampus conveys a compact summary of future events, known formally as the “successor representation”

- When the researchers gradually added a load to one of the handles, making it more difficult to move, the volunteers' judgements about what they saw became biased, and they started to avoid the effortful response

- the participants did not become aware of the increasing load on the handle: their motor system automatically adapted, triggering a change in their perception

- Research has shown that there is a lot of price dispersion in online stores. If customers want to save money, they should search on many different platforms, especially with travel products like flights and hotels

- When a host store sells its in-store advertising space to a competitor, this allows uninformed customers to become aware of substitute offerings in the marketplace and possibly migrate to the competing store, Zia said. The host store may benefit from a commission for customers it sends to the competitor

- it might be optimal for Expedia to increase its average price in order to motivate these customers to click on the link," Zia said. "Because Priceline knows these customers have already observed high prices, that website also can raise prices. So the average prices will be higher on both stores

- After the ice had formed, the scientists slowly raised the temperature and observed it under a microscope. At temperatures between -210°C (-346°F) and -120C (-184°F), it bubbled like boiling water, with a viscosity similar to honey.

- caused by methanol and ammonia being broken up by UV irradiation. As the hydrogen bonds are rearranged, the ice's viscosity is lowered at the same time

- a causal feature would be indeed the Savanna’s visual patterns and an anticausal feature would be the lion’s mane.

- Intrinsic motivation and automatic curricula via asymmetric self-play [Sukhbaatar et al. arXiv17]

- An initial phase of self-playing is set up by splitting the agent into “two separate minds”, Alice and Bob. The authors propose self-playing under the assumption that the environment has to be (nearly) reversible or resettable to the initial state. In this case, Alice executes a task and asks Bob to do the same, by reaching the same observable state of the world where Alice ended up

- Alice and Bob have their distinct rewards functions. Bob has to minimize the time for completion, while Alice is rewarded when Bob takes more time, while being able to achieve the goal. The interplay between these policies allow them to “automatically construct a curriculum of exploration”.

- They tested the idea on a few environments and on a version of StarCraft without enemies to fight. “The target task is to build Marine units. To do this, an agent must follow a specific sequence of operations

- When the default mode network is on, the dorsal attention network is off, and vice versa. We found that the precuneus in tinnitus patients seems to be playing a role in that relationship

`mutate`, `cell`, `houseley`, `gene`, `mechanism`, `adapt`, `copies`, `yeast`

- DNA often contains multiple copies of extended sequences of base pairs or even whole genes. The exact number can vary among individuals because, when cells are duplicating their DNA before cell division, certain mistakes can insert or delete copies of gene sequences

- CUP1, a gene that helps yeast resist the toxic effects of environmental copper. They found that when yeast was exposed to copper, the variation in the number of copies of CUP1 in the cells increased. On average, most cells had fewer copies of the gene, but the yeast cells that gained more copies—about 10 percent of the total population — became more resistant to copper and flourished

- when cells replicate their DNA, the replication mechanism sometimes stalls. Usually the mechanism can restart and pick up where it left off. When it can’t, the cell can go back to the beginning of the replication process, but in doing so, it sometimes accidentally deletes a gene sequence or makes extra copies of it. That is what causes normal copy number variation

- Houseley and his team made the case that a combination of factors makes these copying errors especially likely to hit genes that are actively responding to environmental stresses, which means that they are more likely to show copy number variation

- Scientists have used magnetism to activate tiny groups of cells in the brain, inducing bodily movements that include running, rotating and losing control of the extremities

- The technique researchers developed is called magneto-thermal stimulation

- Magneto-thermal stimulation involves using magnetic nanoparticles to stimulate neurons outfitted with temperature-sensitive ion channels. The brain cells fire when the nanoparticles are heated by an external magnetic field, causing the channels to open.

- First, scientists use genetic engineering to introduce a special strand of DNA into targeted neurons, causing these cells to produce a heat-activated ion channel. Then, researchers inject specially crafted magnetic nanoparticles into the same area of the brain. These nanoparticles latch onto the surface of the targeted neurons, forming a thin covering like the skin of an onion.

- 26 participants wore fNIRS headbands while they completed three different art activities (each with rest periods between). For three minutes each, the participants colored in a mandala, doodled within or around a circle marked on a paper, and had a free-drawing session.

- During all three activities, there was a measured increase in bloodflow in the brain's prefrontal cortex, compared to rest periods where bloodflow decreased to normal rates.

- Doodling in or around the circle had the highest average measured bloodflow increase in the reward pathway compared to free-drawing (the next highest) and coloring. However, the difference between each form of art-making was not statistically significant, according to analysis

- Doodling seemed to initiate the most brain activity in artists, but free-drawing was observed to be about the same for artists and non-artists. Interestingly, the set coloring activity actually resulted in negative brain activity in artists.

- revealed the essential role of dendritic mitochondrial flash in transforming short-term synaptic plasticity into long-term plasticity, which is known to be the cellular correlates of long-term memory. 

- Mitochondrial flash or 'mitoflash' was first identified by Dr. CHENG Heping's team at PKU as a quantized signal at single-mitochondrion level, involving mitochondrial events such as membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and matrix alkalization that last for tens of seconds. 

- hypothesized that mitoflash might be involved in signaling transduction of synaptic plasticity

- found that synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) was always accompanied by one or more mitoflashes in nearby dendritic mitochondria after chemical, electrical or glutamate uncaging induced LTP

- artificially induced mitoflashes could in turn facilitate transition from short-term synaptic potentiation to long-term potentiation

- Further study revealed that synaptic calcium and calcium-calmodulin kinase was important for eliciting mitoflash, which in turn released ROS to signal long-term synaptic plasticity

### :dart: Brief reactivation of a learned memory (quickly typing numbers with one hand)  in temporal proximity of a very similar task (typing numbers with the other hand) gives that memory long-term immunity to interference with other tasks during multi-tasking.

`memories`, `task`, `brain`, `perform`, `learn`, `reactivated`, `research`, `censor`

- research identifies a brain mechanism that enables more efficient multitasking. The key to this is "reactivating the learned memory," a process that allows a person to more efficiently learn or engage in two tasks in close conjunction

- When we learn a new task, we have great difficulty performing it and learning something else at the same time

- This is due to interference between the two tasks, which compete for the same brain resources

- Our research demonstrates that the brief reactivation of a single learned memory, in appropriate conditions, enables the long-term prevention of, or immunity to, future interference in the performance of another task performed in close conjunction

- researchers first taught student volunteers to perform a sequence of motor finger movements with one hand, by learning to tap onto a keypad a specific string of digits appearing on a computer screen as quickly and accurately as possible. After acquiring this learned motor memory, the memory was reactivated on a different day, during which the participants were required to briefly engage with the task -- this time with an addition of brief exposure to the same motor task performed with their other hand

- By utilizing the memory reactivation paradigm, the subjects were able to perform the two tasks without interference

- By uniquely pairing the brief reactivation of the original memory with the exposure to a new memory, long-term immunity to future interference was created, demonstrating a prevention of interference even a month after the exposures.

`memories`, `forget`, `brain`, `remember`, `information`, `neuron`, `richards`, `mechanism`

- A new review paper proposes that the goal of memory is not to transmit the most accurate information over time, but to guide and optimize intelligent decision making by only holding on to valuable information

- It's important that the brain forgets irrelevant details and instead focuses on the stuff that's going to help make decisions in the real world

- We find plenty of evidence from recent research that there are mechanisms that promote memory loss, and that these are distinct from those involved in storing information

- forgetting allows us to adapt to new situations by letting go of outdated and potentially misleading information that can no longer help us maneuver changing environments

- The second way forgetting facilitates decision making is by allowing us to generalize past events to new ones. In artificial intelligence this principle is called regularization and it works by creating simple computer models that prioritize core information but eliminate specific details, allowing for wider application

- A constantly changing environment may require that we remember less

`studied`, `word`, `student`, `attention`, `recall`, `distracted`, `participants`, `value`

- Multitasking while studying may impair overall memory for the study material, but your ability to strategically identify and remember the most important information may stay intact

- researchers asked 192 undergraduate student participants to view a series of word lists and remember as many words as possible. Importantly, each word had a numerical value, from 1 to 10, and participants were instructed to maximize the total value of the words they recalled

- Students randomly assigned to the divided attention group studied the word lists as digits were also being read aloud -- they were instructed to press a key every time they heard three odd digits in a row. Other students studied the lists while lyrical music, with which they were familiar or unfamiliar, played in the background. Another group of students studied with no additional distractions.

- As expected, those students who were forced to divide their attention between the word list and the digits recalled fewer words compared with the students in the other groups. The data showed that the background music had no discernible effect on students' overall recall.

- students really did seem to pay attention to the value of the words -- their odds of recalling a 10-point word were almost five times greater than their odds of recalling a 1-point word. The link between value and recall held for students in all of the groups, regardless of whether they studied with or without distraction

### :dart: The fronto-parietal network appears to perform emulation, evidenced by the commonality of its deverse functions (planning and executing, mental rotation, working memory, etc.).

`function`, `motor`, `cognition`, `movement`, `brain`, `network`, `motor skills`, `fronto parietal network`

- fronto-parietal network is responsible for a range of highly diverse functions, from planning and executing movements to mental rotation, and from spatial attention to working memory. But how can a single network participate in such a wide variety of functions?

- recently put forward an original hypothesis -- all these cognitive functions rely on one central function: emulation

- the fronto-parietal network is activated by very disparate tasks. This is the case for motor activities, such as picking up or pointing to an object, as well as for eye movements -- and even when no movement is involved, if we shift our attention or perform a mental calculation

- A review of all the data currently available suggests that the tasks share a common process, which the scientists have termed "emulation." This process, which consists of planning and representing a movement without actually performing it, activates the brain network in the same way as real movements.

- "But we hypothesise that the brain goes a step further," explains Dr Ptak: "It uses such dynamic representations to carry out increasingly complex cognitive functions beyond just planning movements."

-  the skier who mentally rehearses his race before starting improves his performance. Such anticipated action prepares him for movements that are more accurate and precise.

- Their new system employs a network of electronic oscillators to solve graph coloring tasks -- a type of problem that tends to choke modern computers

- In natural forms of computing, dynamical systems with complex interdependencies evolve rapidly and solve complex sets of equations in a massively parallel fashion.

- When a group of oscillators were electrically connected via capacitive links, they automatically synchronized to the same frequency -- oscillating at the same rate. Meanwhile, oscillators directly connected to one another would operate at different phases within the same frequency, and oscillators in the same group but not directly connected would sync in both frequency and phase

- The next step would be building a larger network of oscillators that could handle graph coloring problems with more objects at play

`brain`, `pitkow`, `model`, `computations`, `bias`, `research`, `neuron`, `neuroscience`

- the brain's ability to perform "approximate probabilistic inference" cannot be truly studied with simple tasks that are "ill-suited to expose the inferential computations that make the brain special."

- "Evolution has given us what we call a good model bias," Pitkow said. "It's been known for a couple of decades that very simple neural networks can compute any function, but those universal networks can be enormous

- "In contrast, if you have the right kind of model -- not a completely general model that could learn anything, but a more limited model that can learn specific things, especially the kind of things that often happen in the real world -- then you have a model that's biased. In this sense, bias can be a positive trait

- They suggested that the brain infers solutions based on statistical crosstalk between redundant population codes. Population codes are responses by collections of neurons that are sensitive to certain inputs, like the shape or movement of an object.

- to better understand the brain, it can be more useful to describe what these populations compute, rather than precisely how each individual neuron computes it. Pitkow said this means thinking "at the representational level" rather than the "mechanistic level,"

`farmer`, `plant`, `pest`, `optimal`, `system`, `decisions`, `water`, `reach`

- Bali's famous rice terraces, when seen from above, look like colorful mosaics because some farmers plant synchronously, while others plant at different times

- Farmers that live upstream have the advantage of always having water; while those downstream have to adapt their planning on the schedules of the upstream farmers

- When farmers are planting at different times, pests can move from one field to another, but when farmers plant in synchrony, pests drown and the pest load is reduced. So upstream farmers have an incentive to share water so that synchronous planting can happen. However, water resources are limited and there is not enough water for everybody to plant at the same time

- As a result of this constraint, fractal planting patterns emerge, which yield close to maximal harvests

- this optimal situation arises without central planners or coordination. Farmers interact locally and take local individual free decisions, which they believe will optimize their own harvest

- this is in contrast to the tragedy of the commons, where the global optimum is not reached because everyone is maximizing his individual profit

First, the team measured DRNDA activity while the animals encountered salient stimuli, such as the arrival of a potential mating partner, or a sudden unpleasant sensation, or food. The DRNDA neurons were highly active during these events

- these neurons are least active when the animal is sleeping and increase in activity as the animal is waking up

- After stimulating these neurons with light during the time that the animal would normally sleep, Gradinaru and her team found that the mouse woke up from sleep and remained awake. The reverse was true when the activity of DRNDA was chemically silenced -- the animal was likely to fall asleep, even in the face of motivationally important stimuli, such as the odor of a predator or a mating partner

### :dart: Most neurons start out with many more connections that they need, and the ones not used are pruned. Chandelier interneuron cells develop exclusively inhibitory synapses at other cells' initial axon segments, leading to a greater impact.

`cell`, `develop`, `chandelier cell`, `axon`, `synapse`, `neurons`, `cell axon`, `varicosities`

- A basic tenet of neural development is that young neurons make far more connections than they will actually use, with very little specificity. They selectively maintain only the ones that they end up needing

- Once many of these connections are made, the brain employs a use-it or lose-it strategy; if the organism's subsequent experiences stimulate the synapse, it will strengthen and survive. If not, the synapse will weaken and eventually disappear

- a unique type of inhibitory interneuron called chandelier cells -- which are implicated in several diseases affecting the brain such as schizophrenia and epilepsy -- seem to develop their connections differently than other types of neurons.

- Most cells' axons reach out and form synapses on other cells' dendrites or cell bodies, but chandelier cells exclusively inhibitory synapse on other cells' axon initial segments (AIS), right where the cell begins to send its own signal down the axon. At this location, the chandelier cells have a greater impact on other cell's behavior.

- They used data on weekly alcohol intake and cognitive performance measured repeatedly over 30 years (1985-2015) for 550 healthy men and women

- After adjusting for these confounders, the researchers found that higher alcohol consumption over the 30 year study period was associated with increased risk of hippocampal atrophy

- Our findings support the recent reduction in UK safe limits and call into question the current US guidelines, which suggest that up to 24.5 units a week is safe for men, as we found increased odds of hippocampal atrophy at just 14-21 units a week, and we found no support for a protective effect of light consumption on brain structure

- analyzed how neurons in a critical part of the brain, called V2, respond to natural scenes, providing a better understanding of vision processing.

- The team revealed that V2 neurons process visual information according to three principles: first, they combine edges that have similar orientations, increasing robustness of perception to small changes in the position of curves that form object boundaries. 

- Second, if a neuron is activated by an edge of a particular orientation and position, then the orientation 90 degrees from that will be suppressive at the same location, a combination termed "cross-orientation suppression." These cross-oriented edge combinations are assembled in various ways to allow us to detect various visual shapes. The team found that cross-orientation was essential for accurate shape detection.

- The third principle is that relevant patterns are repeated in space in ways that can help perceive textured surfaces of trees or water and boundaries between them, as in impressionist paintings.

- The researchers incorporated the three organizing principles into a model they named the Quadratic Convolutional model

### :dart: Hippocampal cells predict memory decisions through prospective coding, and the prefrontal cortex teaches the hippocampus to learn rules to distinguism memory-based predictions in otherwise identical situations (ex. you answer a telephone in your own home but not a stranger's).

`learn`, `prefrontal cortex`, `goal`, `memories`, `hippocampal`, `hippocampus`, `rat`, `rat learn`

- Neurons in the prefrontal cortex "teach" neurons in the hippocampus to "learn" rules that distinguish memory-based predictions in otherwise identical situations, suggesting that learning in the present helps guide learning in the future

- The hippocampus is a temporal lobe brain structure needed for remembering recent events: for example, where you ate your last meal. The prefrontal cortex is where the brain uses context to switch flexibility between remembered rules, such as knowing to look left before crossing a street in North America but right before crossing in Britain. Without such rules, memories interfere with one another and predictions based on memory are inaccurate.

- High-functioning individuals rapidly integrate memories with goals to choose their course of action. This cognitive flexibility requires interaction between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 

- We want to understand how our brains learn to think ahead and the mechanisms that use context to recall events, predict outcomes and inform decisions. For example, how does the brain know to answer a ringing telephone at home but not in someone else's house?

- We already knew that hippocampal cells predicted memory decisions through prospective coding, firing at different rates before rats chose different goals. We learned that inactivating the prefrontal cortex reduced prospective coding by the hippocampus. Furthermore, the more the prefrontal cortex altered hippocampal activity as rats learned one rule, the faster they switched to the next rule

- We found that neuronal activity was synchronized in the two structures, and that neurons in the prefrontal cortex modulated hippocampal place cell activity during learning

- Most factors that help make schools successful cost lots of money - think teachers, technology and textbooks

- a new study suggests one factor that doesn't need any cash to implement can play an important role in helping students succeed at even the most disadvantaged schools

- That factor is what scientists call social capital: The network of relationships between school officials, teachers, parents and the community that builds trust and norms that promote academic achievement

- In a study of 96 public high schools in Ohio, researchers found that schools with higher levels of social capital also had students who performed better on state-mandated math and reading tests. The results held true as much for urban schools in high-poverty areas as they did for wealthy suburban schools.

- Wealthy schools do have an advantage in terms of social capital, but it is not overwhelming

`magnet`, `properties`, `layer`, `chromium triiodide`, `material`, `two dimensional`, `2d`, `even`

- After years of searching, many suspected that true two-dimensional magnets might not actually exist. But now we finally have proof - physicists have created the first ever 2D magnet

- They decided to focus on a compound called chromium triiodide (or CrI3), because it's ferromagnetic in its three-dimensional form

- Chromium triiodide is also easily reduced to two dimensions via the 'Scotch tape method' - using adhesive tape to peel off layer after layer until it's just one atom thick

- the researchers tested its magnetic properties by shining a beam of polarised light at its surface. 

- If it was still magnetic, the aligned spin of its electrons could be detected in the reflection of the beam, and sure enough, that's what the team found

- They also discovered that a two-layered sheet of this material isn't magnetic, but when a third is added the substance becomes a ferromagnet again. The material remains magnetic if a fourth layer is added, but gains other properties

- Scientists have found a way to improve creativity through brain stimulation

- achieved this by temporarily suppressing a key part of the frontal brain called the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is involved in most of our thinking and reasoning

- participants who received the intervention showed an enhanced ability to 'think outside the box'

- We solve problems by applying rules we learn from experience, and the DLPFC plays a key role in automating this process

- It works fine most of the time, but fails spectacularly when we encounter new problems which require a new style of thinking -- our past experience can indeed block our creativity

- But the researchers also observed that these participants got worse at solving problems with a higher working memory demand (where many items are needed to be held in mind at once). These problems require the participants to try a number of different moves until finding the solution, which means they have to keep track of their mental operations.

`neuron`, `decision`, `collect`, `monkey`, `data`, `information`, `single neuron`, `neuroscience`

- When many individual neurons collect data, how do they reach a unanimous decision? 

- as the monkey initially processes the data, polling many neurons is required to get a good prediction of the monkey's decision. Then, as the time for committing to a decision approaches, this pattern shifts. The neurons start to agree and eventually each one on its own is maximally predictive

- at first the "neural voice" is heterogeneous and collective, but as the neurons get close to the decision point, the "neural voice" becomes homogenous and, in a sense, individualistic, as any neuron on its own is sufficient to read the monkey's mind

- a possible explanation for this odd behavior is that the system has two tasks to solve. It must gather good information from noisy data and it must use this information to produce a coherent decision

- an information accumulation phase that uses crowdsourcing to collect reliable information and a consensus phase that allows the system to act

- Look at the weight matrix as if it were an image. We may compress it by encoding it through the coefficients of a Fourier-type transform (here: the discrete cosine transform DCT) [1-8]. While a successful RNN controller may need hundreds of thousands of parameters (weights) to solve its task, its compressed description may need just a few hundred.

- Unlike to existing words, new words showed a neural response enhancement between the early and late stages of exposure on the left frontal and temporal cortices, which was interpreted as the build-up of neural memory circuits. The magnitude of this neural enhancement also correlated with how well the participants remembered the new words afterwards

- To examine the effect of attention, the words were presented for ~30 minutes in two conditions: participants were either passively exposed to the spoken words on the background, or they attended to the speech. Similar neural enhancement to novel words was observed in both listening conditions

- Bilinguals go back and forth between their languages rapidly and, often, unconsciously -- a phenomenon called code-switching.

- But different languages also embody different worldviews, different ways of organizing the world around us. And time is a case in point. For example, Swedish and English speakers prefer to mark the duration of events by referring to physical distances, e.g. a short break, a long wedding, etc. The passage of time is perceived as distance travelled.

- But Greek and Spanish speakers tend to mark time by referring to physical quantities, e.g. a small break, a big wedding. The passage of time is perceived as growing volume.

`robot`, `evolution`, `develop`, `evolvability`, `epigenetic factor`, `evolutionary`, `create`, `physical embodied`

- For the first time, researchers in the field of evolutionary robotics have used physically embodied robots to study epigenetic effects on robot evolution

- In evolutionary robotics, an artificial "gene pool" is created, which produces genomes each of which encodes the control system of a robot. Each robot is then allowed to act and perform tasks according to its "genetically" specified controller, and the robot's fitness is ranked according to how well it performs a certain task. The robots are then allowed to reproduce by swapping genetic material with each other, comparable to biological sexual reproduction

- the genomes of living organisms are also affected by development -- events during their lifetime that lead to epigenetic changes. In biology, this interplay between evolution and development is known as evo-devo, which has emphasized the importance of non-genetic factors on an organism's phenotype

- The results show that robot populations with an epigenetic factor evolved differently than populations where development was not taken into account. Despite the robots not evolving greater light capturing skills, the team are enthusiastic about the results, since the aim of this preliminary study was above all to demonstrate the importance of including epigenetic factors in robot evolution, and to develop a conceptual and physical methodology that makes this possible

- There’s some evidence that people with a greater degree of openness also have better visual awareness. For example, when focusing on letters moving on a screen, they are more likely to notice a grey square appearing elsewhere on the display.

- Antinori and her colleagues asked 123 university students to complete a binocular rivalry test, in which they simultaneously saw a red image with one eye and a green image with the other eye for 2 minutes.

- Usually, the brain can only perceive one image at a time, and most participants reported seeing the image flip between red and green. But some subjects saw the two images fused into a patchwork of red and green – a phenomenon known as “mixed percept”.

- The higher the participants scored for openness on a personality questionnaire, the more they experienced this mixed perception.

- Does the brain create additional synapses from the cortical neurons to the new granule cells, or do some cortical neurons transfer connections from mature granule cells to the new granule cells? Researchers have found that the connections are transferred, without adding to the number of synapses.

- The dentate gyrus is one of just two areas in the brain where new neurons are continuously formed in adults. When a new granule cell neuron is made in the dentate gyrus, it needs to get 'wired in,' by forming synapses, or connections, in order to contribute to circuit function

- Striking electron microscope pictures from inside the brains of mice suggest what happens in our own brain every day: Our synapses -- the junctions between nerve cells -- grow strong and large during the stimulation of daytime, then shrink by nearly 20 percent while we sleep, creating room for more growth and learning the next day.

- The scaling occurred in about 80 percent of the synapses but spared the largest ones, which may be associated with the most stable memory traces.

`memories`, `hippocampus`, `prefrontal cortex`, `store`, `engram cells`, `trace`, `research`, `studies`

- A study of neural circuits that underlie memory consolidation reveals memories are formed simultaneously in the hippocampus and long-term storage location of brain's cortex, with long-term memories remaining 'silent' for two weeks before maturing, which upends dominant theories of memory consolidation.

- Just one day after the fear-conditioning event, the researchers found that memories of the event were being stored in engram cells in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. However, the engram cells in the prefrontal cortex were "silent" -- they could stimulate freezing behavior when artificially activated by light, but they did not fire during natural memory recall.

- This study already showed that communication between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus is critical, because blocking the circuit connecting those two regions prevented the cortical memory cells from maturing properly.

- People's ability to make random choices or mimic a random process, such as coming up with hypothetical results for a series of coin flips, peaks around age 25, according to a study.

- Previous studies have shown that aging diminishes a person's ability to behave randomly. However, it had been unclear how this ability evolves over a person's lifetime, nor had it been possible to assess the ways in which humans may behave randomly beyond simple statistical tests.

- The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would "look random to somebody else," 

- The study also demonstrated that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior.

- If you tell a 3-year-old child the following story of little Maxi, they will most probably not understand: Maxi puts his chocolate on the kitchen table, then goes to play outside. While he is gone, his mother puts the chocolate in the cupboard. Where will Maxi look for his chocolate whenhe comes back?

- A 3-year-old child will not understand why Maxi would be surprised not to find the chocolate on the table where he left it. It is only by the age of 4 years that a child will correctly predict that Maxi will look for his chocolate where he left it and not in the cupboard where it is now.

- The maturation of fibres of a brain structure called the arcuate fascicle between the ages of three and four years establishes a connection between two critical brain regions: a region at the back of the temporal lobe that supports adult thinking about others and their thoughts, and a region in the frontal lobe that is involved in keeping things at different levels of abstraction

- Overall, the winning method more than doubled memory performance compared to the standard technique of repeated study. The method combined adaptive retrieval practice, where the hardest words to remember were presented more often, and an introduction to mental imagery.

- volunteers were asked to imagine the words in certain rooms so that they could later practice recalling the words by room. Besides being the most effective, participants also found the winning method to be the most enjoyable of all submissions

- Neurons are large, tree-like structures made up of a body, the soma, with numerous branches called dendrites extending outward. Somas generate brief electrical pulses called "spikes" in order to connect and communicate with each other. Scientists had generally believed that the somatic spikes activate the dendrites, which passively send currents to other neurons' somas

- the UCLA team discovered that dendrites are not just passive conduits. Their research showed that dendrites are electrically active in animals that are moving around freely, generating nearly 10 times more spikes than somas.

-  These results show that the dendrites do not behave purely like a digital device. Dendrites do generate digital, all-or-none spikes, but they also show large analog fluctuations that are not all or none.

- tested the theory in a series of experiments where people were shown very short video clips of moving objects, then given memory tests. Sometimes the objects appeared to move across the screen as a single object would. Other times they moved in ways we wouldn't expect a single object to move, such as popping out from one side of the screen and then the other.

- In every experiment, subjects had significantly better memories -- as much as nearly 20 percent better -- of trackable objects that moved according to our expectations, the researchers found.

- Humans have a type of long-term memory (called 'implicit memory') that means we respond less to stimuli as they are repeated over time, in a process called neural adaptation. But the new research suggests that dyslexics recover faster than non-dyslexics from their responses to stimuli such as sounds and written words, leading to their perceptual and reading difficulties. 

- We decided to test this hypothesis by increasing the length of time between consecutive stimuli and measuring how it affects behavioral biases and neural responses from the auditory cortex, a section of the brain that processes sound.

- Participants with dyslexia showed a faster decay of implicit memory on both measures. This also affected their oral reading rate, which decreased faster as a result of the time interval between reading the same nonword -- a group of letters that looks or sounds like a word -- numerous times

- Rather than having strictly defined routes of communication between different areas, the level of coordination between different parts of the brain seems to ebb and flow. Now, by analyzing the brains of a large number of people at rest or carrying out complex tasks, researchers at have learned that the integration between those brain regions also fluctuates. When the brain is more integrated, people do better on complex tasks.

- the researchers measured pupil size to try and tease out how the brain coordinates this change in connectivity. Pupil size is an indirect measure of the activity of a small region in the brainstem called the locus coeruleus that is thought to amplify or mute signals across the entire brain.

- Up to a certain point, increases in pupil size likely indicate greater amplification of strong signals and greater muting of weak signals across the brain.

- The researchers found that pupil size roughly tracked with changes in brain connectivity during rest, in that larger pupils were associated with greater connectedness. This suggests that the noradrenaline coming from the locus coeruleus might be what drives the brain to become more integrated during highly complicated cognitive tasks, allowing a person to perform well on that task.

The study focused on their retention of both the general plot of the films as well as such details as sounds, colors, gestures, background details and other peripheral information that allow a person to re-experience an event in rich and vivid detail

- Researchers also found that giving students a brief visual cue from the movie later -- even a simple glimpse of the title and a little sliver of a screenshot taken from the film -- seemed to jog the memory

- After viewing the film clips, researchers asked what they remembered about the films after delays ranging from several minutes after the showings up to seven days later.

- Researchers found that: (1) all participants recalled less about both the details and the substance of the films over a longer gap of time. But they forgot the perceptual or 'peripheral' details from the films more quickly than the films' central themes. (2) the second group of students, who were given cues before being asked to recall the films, did better at retrieving the faded memory of the peripheral details. However, their retention of central information was not much different from the first group (3) the third group -- who retrieved the memory of the films by telling someone about them soon after viewing -- remembered both central and peripheral information better over time.

- Fast talkers tend to convey less information with each word and syntactic structure than slower-paced speakers, meaning that no matter our pace, we all say just about as much in a given time, a new study finds.

- In information theory, rarer word choices convey greater "lexical information," while more complicated syntax, such as the passive voice, conveys greater "structural information." To stay within the channel, those who talk quickly speak with more common words and simpler syntax, while those with a slower pace tend to use rarer, more unexpected words and more complicated wordings

- analyzed two independent troves of conversational data: the Switchboard Corpus, which contains 2,400 annotated telephone conversations, and the Buckeye Corpus, which consists of 40 lengthy interviews. In total, the data included the speech of 398 people.

- On average, while both men and women exhibited the main trend, men conveyed more information than women at the same speech rate. There is no reason to believe that the ability to convey information at a given rate differs by gender, Cohen Priva said. Instead, he hypothesizes, women may tend to be more concerned with making sure their listeners understand what they are saying.

`neuron`, `output neuron`, `inhibitory neuron`, `signal`, `circuit`, `model`, `converge neuron`, `researchers`

- Researchers have developed a new computational model of a neural circuit in the brain, which could shed light on the biological role of inhibitory neurons

- The model describes a neural circuit consisting of an array of input neurons and an equivalent number of output neurons. The circuit performs what neuroscientists call a "winner-take-all" operation, in which signals from multiple input neurons induce a signal in just one output neuron.

- the researchers prove that, within the context of their model, a certain configuration of inhibitory neurons provides the most efficient means of enacting a winner-take-all operation

- Signals from the output neurons pass to the inhibitory neurons, whose output in turn passes back to the output neurons. The signaling of the output neurons also feeds back on itself, which proves essential to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- in the brain, increasing the strength of the signal traveling over an input neuron only increases the chances that an output neuron will fire. The same is true of the nodes in the researchers' model. Again, this modification is crucial to enacting the winner-take-all strategy.

- with only one inhibitory neuron, it's impossible, in the context of their model, to enact the winner-take-all strategy. But two inhibitory neurons are sufficient. The trick is that one of the inhibitory neurons -- which the researchers call a convergence neuron -- sends a strong inhibitory signal if more than one output neuron is firing. The other inhibitory neuron -- the stability neuron -- sends a much weaker signal as long as any output neurons are firing.

- The convergence neuron drives the circuit to select a single output neuron, at which point it stops firing; the stability neuron prevents a second output neuron from becoming active once the convergence neuron has been turned off. The self-feedback circuits from the output neurons enhance this effect.

- Without randomness, however, the circuit won't converge to a single output neuron: Any setting of the inhibitory neurons' weights will affect all the output neurons equally. "You need randomness to break the symmetry,"

- Do real inhibitory neurons exhibit the same division between convergence neurons and stability neurons?

`babies`, `develop`, `stimulated`, `neurons`, `challenged`, `brain`, `skills`, `must`

- Many new parents still think that babies should develop at their own pace, and that they shouldn't be challenged to do things that they're not yet ready for.

- this mindset can be traced back to the early 1900s, when professionals were convinced that our genes determine who we are, and that child development occurred independently of the stimulation that a baby is exposed to.

- neurons in the brains of young children quickly increase in both number and specialization as the baby learns new skills and becomes more mobile. Neurons in very young children form up to a thousand new connections per second.

- Van der Meer's research also shows that the development of our brain, sensory perception and motor skills happen in sync. She believes that even the smallest babies must be challenged and stimulated at their level from birth onward. They need to engage their entire body and senses by exploring their world and different materials, both indoors and out and in all types of weather.

-  the experiences must be self-produced; it is not enough for children merely to be carried or pushed in a stroller.

- Babies actually manage to distinguish between the sounds of any language in the world when they are four months old, but by the time they are eight months old they have lost this ability

### :dart: A coupling of slow oscillations (~0.75 Hz), spindles (12-16 Hz), and ripples (80-100Hz) occurs during relocation of short-term memories from hippocampus to cortex during NREM sleep stage.

`oscillation`, `sos`, `spindles`, `hippocampus`, `hz`, `memory trace`, `happen`, `brain`

- Short-term memory traces in the hippocampus, an area deep in the brain, are then relocated to more outer parts of the brain. An international team of neuroscientists now shows how a three-step brain oscillation plays an important part in that process.

- 'Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is responsible for the memory consolidation during our sleep', Bonnefond explains. 'NREM is known for its very slow oscillations (SOs). Other types of oscillations are hidden inside these SOs.

- We discovered that three types of oscillations are nested inside each other in the hippocampus and have a joint function.'

- Slow oscillations only happen about once per second (~0.75 Hz). 

- In a specific time frame within these SOs, Bergmann, Bonnefond and their colleagues found clusters of oscillations of an intermediate speed: the so called spindles which happen about 15 times per second (12 -- 16 Hz). And within these spindles, they found clusters of superfast oscillations called ripples, which happen about 90 times per second (80 -- 100 Hz), and which reflect the local reactivation of the memory trace to be shuttled to the cortex.

- we see that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. And we hypothesize that they provide fine-tuned temporal frames for the transfer of memory traces to the neocortex

`neurons`, `hippocampal`, `adult humans`, `et al`, `700`, `75`, `subpopulation`, `hieber`

- There is evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans, although whether its extent is sufficient to have functional significance has been questioned

- We found that a large subpopulation of hippocampal neurons, constituting one third of the neurons, is subject to exchange. In adult humans, 700 new neurons are added per day, corresponding to an annual turnover of 1.75% of the neurons within the renewing fraction, with a modest decline during aging.

- New neurons integrate throughout life in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of most mammals. The newborn neurons have enhanced synaptic plasticity for a limited time after their differentiation (Ge et al., 2007; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004), which is critical for their role in mediating pattern separation in memory formation and cognition in rodents

`instinctive`, `prefrontal cortex`, `connection`, `brainstem`, `region`, `mice`, `behavior`, `found`

- The driver of our instincts is the brainstem -- the region at the very base of your brain, just above the spinal chord. Scientists have known for some time that another brain region, the prefrontal cortex, plays a role in keeping those instincts in check

- Gross and colleagues have literally found the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem.

- went on to confirm that this physical connection was the brake that inhibits instinctive behavior. They found that in mice that have been repeatedly defeated by another mouse -- the murine equivalent to being bullied -- this connection weakens, and the mice act more scared. The scientists found that they could elicit those same fearful behaviors in mice that had never been bullied, simply by using drugs to block the connection between prefrontal cortex and brainstem

- found that the connection from the prefrontal cortex is to a very specific region of the brainstem, called the PAG, which is responsible for the acting out of our instincts. However, it doesn't affect the hypothalamus, the region that controls feelings and emotions

- So the prefrontal cortex keeps behavior in check, but doesn't affect the underlying instinctive feeling: it stops you from running off-stage, but doesn't abate the butterflies in your stomach

- investigated how the sense of touch of 30 study participants could be changed after a training phase. Half of them received a medium dose of the stress hormone cortisol, while the other half received a placebo drug.

- Tactile performance was assessed using the so-called "two-point discrimination threshold." This marker indicates how far apart two stimuli need to be, to be discriminated as two separate sensations -- the closer they are, the better the sense of touch.

- The placebo group improved their tactile acuity, as expected, by about 15 percent. In contrast, the cortisol given to the other group blocked almost all the stimulation-induced improvement.

- In previous studies on a cellular level, neuroscientists have demonstrated that cortisol suppresses the strengthening of synaptic connections, and therefore the plasticity of the brain -- its ability to learn.

- Until now, the entorhinal cortex has been considered subservient to the hippocampus in both memory formation and recall. But we show that the medial entorhinal cortex can replay the firing pattern associated with moving in a maze independent of the hippocampus

- The entorhinal cortex could be a new system for memory formation that works in parallel to the hippocampus

- When a spatial memory is formed, cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), especially grid cells, act like a navigational system. They provide the hippocampus with information on where an animal is and give cues as to how far and in what direction the animal has moved

- During both sleep and waking periods, the sMEC triggers its own replay and initiates recall and consolidation independent of the hippocampus

### :dart: Perhaps due to brain hemisphere specialization, mammal infants like to position themselves on the left of their mothers, so as to better keep track of her. However, if a threat emerges, the positions reverse so the mother can better keep track of child.

`mother`, `left`, `infant`, `mammal`, `babies`, `situations`, `prefer`, `keep`

-  it seems many mammal babies prefer to approach their mother from one side too – and the explanation may lie in the contrasting talents of each half of the brain

- Some researchers think this explains why human and ape mothers tend to cradle their babies on the left: it is so they can better monitor their facial expressions with their left eye.

- Infants of all species were more likely to position themselves so that their mother was on their left. This happened about three-quarters of the time.

- found that mammal infants who keep their mother on their left are better able to keep track of her and hence increase their chance of survival

- However, if a threat emerges, the roles often reverse, Ingram says. “Infants keep their mother on their left in normal situations such as moving forward or suckling,” she says. “But when faced with stressful situations such as when fleeing, mothers prefer their infant on their left side so they can better monitor them.”

- False memory was discovered in an experiment that asked volunteers to memorise lists of related words and then recall them. When they learned “bed”, “drowsy” and “dream”, about half later also remembered the word “sleep”. 

- well-rested brains normally use “associative memory” to link related concepts together. “There’s a lot of evidence that the brain cares less about individual data and more about the gist of it or what it means,”

- They asked 44 people to memorise lists of words when they were well rested, had slept for only four hours on each of the previous four nights, or hadn’t slept at all for the past 30 hours.

- Unsurprisingly, when they were immediately asked to recall these words, the volunteers did less well when partially or completely sleep-deprived. But when shown a new list and asked which ones had been on the original list, sleep-deprived people were less likely to misremember

- This shows that not only were they less able to learn individual items, they were also less able to extract their meaning.

- "Every time you move your eye, the whole world moves on your retina," says Gaby Maimon, head of the Laboratory of Integrative Brain Function. "But you don't perceive an earthquake happening several times a second."

- the brain can tell if visual motion is self-generated, canceling out information that would otherwise make us feel -- and act -- as if the world was whirling around us.

- Each time you shift your gaze (and you do so several times a second), the brain sends a command to the eyes to move. But a copy of that command is issued internally to the brain's own visual system, as well.

- the common fruit fly performs the same kinds of rapid eye movements. The mere 100,000 neurons in its poppy-seed sized brain must therefore handle the same problems of prediction and perception

- During intentional turns, each neuron received a signal that was carefully calibrated to suppress sensitivity to visual motion along the yaw axis alone

`eye contact`, `mental`, `eye`, `resources`, `someone`, `averting`, `disengaging`, `deducing`

- eye contact is one of the most important forms of nonverbal communication

- Human eyes, with their large unpigmented areas, turn out to be great for deducing where someone is looking. This likely makes it all the easier to track someone’s attention

- A recent experiment conducted in Japan suggests that eye contact draws on the same mental resources used for complex tasks, so trying to maintain eye contact can impede your reasoning. In this case, the break in eye contact comes not from emotion, but from the need to preserve cognitive resources. Eye contact can deplete your mental bandwidth.

- Eye contact is something we prefer from birth, but it is not advantageous in every situation. Back in 1998, researchers theorized that averting the gaze from surroundings aids thinking by disengaging from potential distractions around us.

- A decision to express disgust or anger depends on the motives a person seeks to communicate

- a person who expresses disgust is judged to be motivated more by impartial, moral, concerns while a person who expresses anger towards the same immoral act is more likely to be motivated by self-interest.

- participants themselves were more likely to choose to express disgust when their goal was to show that their condemnation of an act was morally motivated, while they chose to express anger when they sought to protest that the act harmed their own interests.

- The findings suggest that disgust is not just an expression of an inner feeling, like nausea or contamination, but a signal that advertises a moral position.

- In an experiment, cognitive psychologists have shown how word comprehension can be sped up – namely by having study participants grasp objects while reading at the same time

- Latest theories in cognitive science research hypothesize that our memory also records physical sensations as part of the words stored

- When the study participants had to grasp an object while reading, their brain processed parts of the meaning of the words earlier than in previous studies in which words were evaluated without something being gripped

- As demonstrated in previous studies, it takes the brain a third of a second to process a word. "In our study, however, we were able to show that comprehension can already begin much earlier, after just a tenth of a second -- if a grasping action is required,"

- This study not only provides evidence that the brain has a common control center for language and movement, but "it also shows that our brain's processing steps shift very quickly and adjust to current tasks

- Using LED lights flickering at a specific frequency, researchers have shown that they can significantly reduce the beta amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease in the visual cortex of mice. This treatment appears to work by stimulating brain waves known as gamma oscillations, which the researchers discovered help the brain suppress beta amyloid production and invigorate cells responsible for destroying the plaques.

- It's a big 'if,' because so many things have been shown to work in mice, only to fail in humans

- Previous studies have hinted that Alzheimer's patients also have impaired gamma oscillations. These brain waves, which range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per second), are believed to contribute to normal brain functions such as attention, perception, and memory.

- After an hour of stimulation at 40 hertz, the researchers found a 40 to 50 percent reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus

- after gamma stimulation, the process for beta amyloid generation is less active

`consolidated`, `memories`, `brain`, `stimuli`, `experience`, `slugs`, `inhibits`, `awakening`

- During consolidation, the brain produces new proteins that strengthen fragile memory traces. However, if a new experience occurs while an existing memory trace is being consolidated, the new stimuli could disrupt the consolidation process

- How does the brain prevent events that occur just after awakening from interrupting the consolidation process?

- The brain partially solves this problem by postponing some of the memory consolidation to a period in which new experiences are minimalized, that is, while we are asleep.

- exposing sea slugs to new stimuli immediately after they wake up does not trigger the formation of new memories

- On awakening, interactions between new experiences and consolidation are prevented because the brain blocks long-term memory arising from the new stimuli. However, when the researchers treated the slugs just prior to the training with a drug that inhibits protein production, they found that the new stimuli could generate long-term memory.

- The major insight from this research is that there is an active process in the brain which inhibits the ability to learn new things and protects the consolidation of memories.

- Every night while you sleep, electrical waves of brain activity circle around each side of your brain, tracing a pattern that, were it on the surface of your head, might look like the twin hair buns of Star Wars' Princess Leia.

- The scale and speed of Princess Leia waves in the cortex is unprecedented, a discovery that advances the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative

- Sleep spindles -- a type of brain wave pattern known to occur in the earliest stages of non-REM sleep -- are associated with memory consolidation. Previous studies showed that the more sleep spindles a human brain exhibits overnight, the more numbers one would remember the next day

- Scientists had long believed that each sleep spindle oscillation peaked at the same time everywhere in the neocortex of the brain

- the sleep spindles weren't peaking simultaneously everywhere in the cortex. Instead, the oscillations were sweeping in circular patterns around and around the neocortex, peaking in one area, and then -- a few milliseconds later -- an adjacent area

- The time scale that these waves travel at is the same speed it takes for neurons to communicate with each other.

- As a memory is being consolidated, Muller and Sejnowski hypothesize, circular sleep spindle waves help form the links between these different aspects of a single memory.

- When they move around, they may create mutations in or alter the activity of a functional gene; transposons can therefore create new genetic profiles in a population for natural selection to act on, in either a positive or negative way.

- two types of transposons, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), have a competitive relationship with one another. In order to replicate, SINEs steal the molecular machinery that LINEs use to copy themselves

- predicted that populations of LINE and SINE elements in the genome are expected to oscillate the way those of, for example, wolves and rabbits might

- these oscillations occur over a timescale that is longer than the human lifespan—waves of Alu elements and L1 elements pushing and pulling at each other in slow motion across generations of the human genomes that carry them

- the study showed new protein synthesis in a specific sub-region of the prefrontal cortex known in rodents as the prelimbic. In humans, this area corresponds to the anterior cortex

- when they closely examined the effects on the brain of conditioning rodents with a mild foot shock, the scientists found several messenger RNAs recruited to polyribosomes in the medial prefrontal cortex -- a clear indication of new protein synthesis there

- if they inhibited new protein synthesis in the prelimbic region right after fear conditioning took place, those memories did not form. But if the researchers waited just a few hours, inhibiting protein synthesis in prelimbic cortex had no impact and the memories took hold

- It may be that the first wave of protein synthesis is critical for encoding contextual fear memory, while second wave in other sub-regions is important for memory storage

- For the first time, we have found a connection between the brainstem region involved in arousal and regions involved in awareness, two prerequisites for consciousness

- The researchers analyzed 36 patients with brainstem lesions, of which 12 led to coma and 24 did not. Mapping the injuries revealed that a small "coma-specific" area of the brainstem -- the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum -- was significantly associated with coma

- Their analysis revealed two areas in the cortex of the brain that were significantly connected to the coma-specific region of the brainstem. One sat in the left, ventral, anterior insula (AI), the other in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Both regions have been implicated previously in arousal and awareness.

- Now, Fusi and his fellow researchers are proposing that these dials are not only operating at different times – but they're also constantly communicating with each other too

- initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional

### :dart: The hippocampal CA3 region, critical for learning and memory, retrieves memories using pattern completion, enabled by a sparse (1%), small-world type architecture.

`network`, `connection`, `ca3`, `pattern completion`, `cell`, `synaptic connection`, `ca3 region`, `hippocampal ca3`

- The hippocampal CA3 region plays a key role in learning and memory. One of the most remarkable properties of the network is its ability to retrieve previously stored memories from incomplete or degraded versions, a phenomenon that is widely known as pattern completion.

- It is generally accepted that the synapses between CA3 pyramidal cells, the recurrent CA3-CA3 synapses, play a key role in pattern completion, but how this exactly works has remained enigmatic.

- Previous theories of the hippocampal formation often depicted the CA3 region as a network of highly interconnected cells.

- they found that connectivity was sparse, with an average connection probability of approximately 1%

- Even more surprisingly, they discovered that connectivity in the network is not random, but exhibits connectivity motifs that occur much more frequently than expected for a random network. Thus, the structure of the hippocampal CA3 network may be somewhat reminiscent of a "small world" architecture as found in social networks.

- synaptic connections between two cells are mediated by only one or two synaptic contacts. This is also remarkable because much higher numbers have been found for excitatory synaptic connections in the neocortex

- the design of synaptic connections based on one or two synaptic contacts also seems useful for pattern completion, apparently because it minimizes redundancy in the flow of information in the network. Thus, both macro- (e.g. motifs) and microconnectivity (e.g. properties of connection) facilitate pattern completion in the CA3 cell network.

- But these dictator cells aren’t the whole story. Crayfish can trigger a tail-flip another way too – via another small set of neurons that effectively act as an oligarchy.

- For many other behaviors, however, nervous systems make decisions through something like Sherrington’s “million-fold democracy.”

- Unlike countries, however, nervous systems can implement multiple forms of government simultaneously. A neuronal dictatorship can coexist with an oligarchy or democracy. The dictator, acting fastest, may trigger the onset of a behavior while other neurons fine-tune the ensuing movements.

- Scientists have debated how the spontaneous waves emerge, and they have not yet determined whether the waves are just a byproduct of activity, or play a causal role in brain functions.

- They found that they could closely replicate the shape of the beta waves in the model by delivering two kinds of excitatory synaptic stimulation to distinct layers in the cortical columns of cells

- Neither the computer models nor the measurements traced the source of the excitatory synaptic stimulations that drive the pyramidal neurons to produce the beta waves, but Jones and her co-authors posit that they likely come from the thalamus

- Participants whose mistakes appeared at least twice as bad as they really were broke past their plateau and continued sharpening their tetherball skills. A control group that remained undeceived showed negligible improvement

- When two events happen in short succession, they feel somehow linked to each other. It turns out that apparent link has a physical manifestation in our brains

- In your brain, and in the brains of lab mice, recollections are physically represented as collections of neurons with strengthened connections to one another. These clusters of connected cells are known as engrams, or memory traces.

- more excitable neurons—that is, brain cells that activate easily—are more likely to be recruited into an engram, so if you increase the excitability of particular neurons, you can preferentially include them in a new engram.

- Neurons in a newly formed memory trace are subsequently more excitable than neighboring brain cells for a transient period of time. It follows then that a memory formed soon after the first might be encoded in an overlapping population of neurons

- Mice should normally form separate memories when events happen 24 hours apart, but when the researchers re-excited the neurons in the first memory engram while the second memory was forming, they could artificially link those experiences

- Decreasing the excitability of the neurons in the first memory during the second event seemed to prevent the second memory from forming.

`bdnf`, `neurons`, `enhance`, `environmental enrichment`, `brain`, `neurotrophic factor`, `factor`, `growth factor`

- Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, also known as BDNF, is a protein[1] that, in humans, is encoded by the BDNF gene.[2][3] BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical Nerve Growth Factor. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery.

- BDNF acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.[4][5] In the brain, it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking

- BDNF expression is significantly enhanced by environmental enrichment and appears to be the primary source of environmental enrichments ability to enhance cognitive processes. Environmental enrichment enhances synaptogenesis, dendridogenesis, and neurogenesis, leading to improved performance on various learning and memory tasks.

- One-over-f equations describe the relative frequency of things that happen over time and can be used to describe such naturally occurring events as annual river flooding or the beating of a human heart. They have been used to describe the way pitch is used in music as well, but until now, no one has thought to test the idea that they could be used to describe the rhythm of the music too.

- by adding another variable to the equation, called a beta, which was used to describe just how predictable a given piece was compared to other pieces, they could solve for beta and find a unique number of for each composer.

- Memory recollection usually starts with a cue – a few notes of a jangly doorbell, say, might remind you of a song. Information about the cue is transmitted from your eyes and ears to your brain’s hippocampus, where a set of cells recognise it. These cells then trigger a pattern of activity in the front of the brain that matches that of the memory.

- A 2003 study, cited in a meta-analysis by Henry L. Roediger III and Jeffrey D. Karpicke, highlights the power of testing for making information stick.

- In the study, researchers led by Mark Wheeler had participants either review a list of 40 words five times or review it once and take four recall tests. Then they took a recall test either 5 minutes or one week later.

- participants who'd read the word list five times performed much better on the recall test five minutes later. But participants who'd read the test just once and been tested performed better on the test one week later.

- More recent research suggests that combining testing with immediate feedback (finding out whether you answered right or wrong) is more effective, and can even boost memory right after the information is learned.

- these studies suggest that the most efficient strategy for remembering something - whether you're learning a new language or studying for a science exam - is simply to practice recalling it.

- A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces

- it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum

- Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum

### :dart: Pairing stimuli with positive emotions (reward) improves memory for similar future stimuli (even if no reward), but only after sleeping first.

`reward`, `remember`, `categories`, `images`, `participant`, `objects`, `animals`, `stimuli`

- Combining a positive emotional component with a given stimulus promotes memory for future stimuli of the same type

- Our brain, quoting Javiera Oyarzún, first author of the study, "works as a sorting machine. Every time we expose ourselves to a stimulus, our brain sorts it out in a category, such as people, animals, objects, etc. This way, whenever we receive new information we can integrate it with similar available information thanks to our ability to generalize

- we usually do not remember the details surrounding our usual way back home, but if during that time we receive a phone call with good news, or we witness a car accident, we will remember those details with much more precision

- we designed a study with volunteers who were shown a series of images corresponding to two categories (objects and animals), but were only rewarded by one of these categories

- As expected, participants remembered those images associated with a reward better

- In a second session, however, they were shown new images of animals and objects, but knowing that this time there would be no reward. "What we saw is that participants not only remembered "rewarding" images better, but also those of the same semantic category despite knowing that they were not associated with any reward,"

- One of the most significant aspects of the published work is that the effects of emotionally positive stimuli on memory storage are not observed until after 24 hours, ie, it is necessary that the participant sleeps.

- gender blends were disliked when, and only when, the faces were first categorised by gender, despite an overall preference of the participants for more feminine features

- In the second experiment, in which some participants were first asked to categorise gender-ambiguous faces by ethnicity, they did not subsequently judge the gender blends as less appealing.

- The first study to systematically measure the number of neurons in the brains of birds has found that they have significantly more neurons packed into their small brains than are stuffed into mammalian and even primate brains of the same mass.

- studies found that the birds could manufacture and use tools, use insight to solve problems, make inferences about cause-effect relationships, recognize themselves in a mirror and plan for future needs, among other cognitive skills previously considered the exclusive domain of primates

- Birds can perform these complex behaviors because birds' forebrains contain a lot more neurons than any one had previously thought -- as many as in mid-sized primates

- Previously, neuroanatomists thought that as brains grew larger neurons had to grow bigger as well because they had to connect over longer distances. "But bird brains show that there are other ways to add neurons: keep most neurons small and locally connected and only allow a small percentage to grow large enough to make the longer connections.

- Gross and colleagues studied the hippocampus, a region of the brain that's long been known to help form memories. Information enters this part of the brain through three different routes. As memories are cemented, connections between neurons along the 'main' route become stronger.

- When they blocked this main route, the scientists found that the mice were no longer capable of learning a Pavlovian response -- associating a sound to a consequence, and anticipating that consequence. But if the mice had learned that association before the scientists stopped information flow in that main route, they could still retrieve that memory

- blocking that main route had an unexpected consequence: the connections along it were weakened, meaning the memory was being erased

- this active push for forgetting only happens in learning situations

- research suggests that there is an "atomic" unit of recognition -- a minimum amount of information an image must contain for recognition to occur

- When the scientists compared the scores of the human subjects with those of the computer models, they found that humans were much better at identifying partial- or low-resolution images

- Almost all the human participants were successful at identifying the objects in the various images, up to a fairly high loss of detail -- after which, nearly everyone stumbled at the exact same point. The division was so sharp, the scientists termed it a "phase transition." "If an already minimal image loses just a minute amount of detail, everybody suddenly loses the ability to identify the object," says Ullman. "That hints that no matter what our life experience or training, object recognition is hardwired and works the same in all of us."

- found that inequality reduced happiness on average. This was true whether people were doing better or worse than another person they had just met

- On average, when someone won a gamble they were happier when their partner also won the same gamble compared to when their partner lost. This difference could be attributed to guilt. Similarly, when people lost a gamble they were happier when their partner also lost compared to when their partner won, a difference that could be attributed to envy.

- The people who gave away half of their money when they had the opportunity showed no envy when they experienced inequality in a different task but showed a lot of guilt. By contrast, those who kept all the money for themselves displayed no signs of guilt in the other task but displayed a lot of envy

- The task may prove to be a useful way of measuring empathy, which could offer insight into social disorders such as borderline personality disorder

The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thoughts are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined."

`tree`, `diameter`, `thin`, `tall`, `height`, `wind`, `speed`, `94`

- nearly all the trees whipped by winds blowing at speeds of 94 miles per hour or more had snapped, regardless of their species, height or diameter, whereas most trees hit by gusts below that threshold were left intact

- Although mathematics alone would predict that the wind speed required for tree fracture should depend on trunk diameter and tree height, nature does not make trees that are both thin and tall. Instead short trees are thin and tall ones thick. Even more, thicker trees have larger defects, such as knots, where stress concentrates when a tree bends.

`photo`, `experience`, `enjoy`, `participants`, `instance`, `activity`, `levels`, `people`

- research suggests that people who take photos of their experiences usually enjoy the events more than people who don't.

- In each experiment, individuals were asked to participate in an activity (e.g., taking a bus tour or eating in a food court) and were either instructed to take photos during the activity or not.

- One critical factor that has been shown to affect enjoyment is the extent to which people are engaged with the experience

- Another instance where photo-taking did not appear to increase enjoyment was when taking photos interfered with the experience itself, such as having to handle bulky and unwieldy camera equipment.

- In one instance, participants went on a virtual safari and observed a pride of lions attacking a water buffalo, a sight most people found aversive. Photo-takers in that instance reported lower levels of enjoyment than those who saw the same encounter but did not take photos

- Participants in one experiment reported higher levels of enjoyment after just taking "mental" pictures as they were going through the experience

"From a vessel deep within the brain, the dilation propagates up along the vessel walls into a surface vessel and then down into other vessels that enter neighboring columns."

`memories`, `neurons`, `anti memories`, `brain`, `store`, `excitatory`, `inhibitory`, `balanced`

- what regulates our ability to store and recall information? New research suggests one of the processes involved is 'anti-memories' – connections between neurons that generate the exact opposite pattern of electrical activity to that of the original memory

- The 'anti-memories' hypothesis comes back to the idea that healthy brain function results from the interaction between two types of brain cells: excitatory and inhibitory neurons

- without this balancing of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) functions, overly excited neurons could give rise to conditions like epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism

- memories are stored in balanced E/I cortical ensembles

- anti-memories "appear to allow multiple memories to be stored in the brain, without interference between these memories"

`cortex`, `brain`, `memory`, `hippocampus`, `slow oscillations`, `sleep`, `synaptic`, `wave ripples`

- How the brain consolidates memory during deep sleep

- Using a computational model, study explains how hippocampus influences synaptic connections in cortex

- During sleep, human and animal brains are primarily decoupled from sensory input. Nevertheless, the brain remains highly active, showing electrical activity in the form of sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (a small region of the brain that forms part of the limbic system) and large-amplitude slow oscillations in the cortex (the outer layer of the cerebrum)

- Traces of episodic memory acquired during wakefulness and initially stored in the hippocampus are progressively transferred to the cortex as long-term memory during sleep

- patterns of slow oscillations in the cortex, which their model spontaneously generates, are influenced by the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and that these patterns of slow oscillations determine synaptic changes in the cortex

- During such memory replay, the corresponding synapses are strengthened for long-term storage in the cortex

- In mathematics, the G-function was introduced by Cornelis Simon Meijer (1936) as a very general function intended to include most of the known special functions as particular cases.

- A notable property is the closure of the set of all G-functions not only under differentiation but also under indefinite integration. In combination with a functional equation that allows to liberate from a G-function G(z) any factor zρ that is a constant power of its argument z, the closure implies that whenever a function is expressible as a G-function of a constant multiple of some constant power of the function argument, f(x) = G(cxγ), the derivative and the antiderivative of this function are expressible so too.

- An interview technique for eliciting intelligence without asking questions has in a series of experiments proven to work very well

- interview style that was based on treating the prisoners with respect and kindness instead of pressuring them with questions and threats of violence

- Instead of an interrogation, Scharff arranged his meeting as a conversation, emphasizing that the most important details were already known, and that all he wanted was help to fill in some minor gaps. This meant that prisoners never knew when they disclosed information that Scharff did not already know, and often ended up revealing much more information than they thought they did.

- The scenario involves a wooden cube with 6-cm sides made of medium-density fiberboard. Each of the six faces is marked with a 6 x 6-cm square lattice for a total of 36 square cells per face. Then round holes (of diameter equal to the length of a square cell) are drilled through random cells all the way through the cube.

- the number of holes that needs to be drilled to collapse this particular cube is always around 13 holes in each of the three directions, or 39 holes total. Their formula shows that, although this critical number changes for different lattice sizes, the critical density of drills is very similar.

When light hits the spherical surface of the cell, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused internal spot, towards the source of the light, with the cells using tiny tentacle-like structures called pili to pull themselves forwards.

- The basolateral amygdala stores the pleasurable memories associated with cocaine, but the pre-frontal cortex manipulates this information, helping an individual to weigh up whether or not to take the drug: if an addicted individual takes the drug, this activates mechanisms in the dorsal striatum

- The pathway links the basolateral amygdala indirectly with the dorsolateral striatum, circumventing the prefrontal cortex. This means that an addicted individual would not necessarily be aware of their desire to take the drug.

- Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study shows that this active ingredient increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.
