- having a rest helps a person to remember what they were told a few minutes earlier. And the effect seems to last

- People who had a 10-minute rest after hearing a story remembered 10 per cent more of it a week later than those who played a spot-the-difference game immediately afterwards

- If you are using LSTMs and you want to train them on problems with very long range dependencies, you should initialize the biases of the forget gates of the LSTMs to large values

-  It is vastly more efficient to train the network on minibatches of 128 examples, because doing so will result in massively greater throughput

- In mathematics, the G-function was introduced by Cornelis Simon Meijer (1936) as a very general function intended to include most of the known special functions as particular cases.

- A notable property is the closure of the set of all G-functions not only under differentiation but also under indefinite integration. In combination with a functional equation that allows to liberate from a G-function G(z) any factor z that is a constant power of its argument z, the closure implies that whenever a function is expressible as a G-function of a constant multiple of some constant power of the function argument, f(x) = G(cx), the derivative and the antiderivative of this function are expressible so too.

- interview style that was based on treating the prisoners with respect and kindness instead of pressuring them with questions and threats of violence

- Instead of an interrogation, Scharff arranged his meeting as a conversation, emphasizing that the most important details were already known, and that all he wanted was help to fill in some minor gaps. This meant that prisoners never knew when they disclosed information that Scharff did not already know, and often ended up revealing much more information than they thought they did.

Then round holes (of diameter equal to the length of a square cell) are drilled through random cells all the way through the cube.

- What the researchers discovered when studying Synechocystis  a species of cyanobacteria found in freshwater lakes and rivers  is that their cell bodies act like a lens. When light hits the spherical surface of the cell, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused internal spot, towards the source of the light, with the cells using tiny tentacle-like structures called pili to pull themselves forwards.

- Research has examined whether using performance brands such as Nike and 3M had any effect on consumers' output

- The effect is strongest among people who are novices in the respective task, such as golf putting or math tests, whereas experts receive little or no boost

- This higher self-esteem lowers their performance anxiety which, in turn, leads to the better performance outcomes

- Individuals addicted to cocaine may have difficulty in controlling their addiction because of a previously-unknown 'back door' into the brain, circumventing their self-control, suggests a new study.

- The basolateral amygdala stores the pleasurable memories associated with cocaine, but the pre-frontal cortex manipulates this information, helping an individual to weigh up whether or not to take the drug: if an addicted individual takes the drug, this activates mechanisms in the dorsal striatum

- The pathway links the basolateral amygdala indirectly with the dorsolateral striatum, circumventing the prefrontal cortex. This means that an addicted individual would not necessarily be aware of their desire to take the drug.

- Concentrating attention on a visual task can render you momentarily 'deaf' to sounds at normal levels

- The phenomenon of 'inattentional deafness', where we fail to notice sounds when concentrating on other things, has been observed by the researchers before

- they have been able to determine, by measuring brain activity in real-time using MEG (magnetoencephalography), that the effects are driven by brain mechanisms at a very early stage of auditory processing

- Apigenin, a substance found in parsley, thyme, chamomile and red pepper, improves neuron formation and strengthens the connections between brain cells, new lab research demonstrates.

- just by applying apigenin to human stem cells in a dish they become neurons after 25 days -- an effect they would not see without the substance

- we can speculate that a diet rich in flavonoids may influence the formation of neurons and the way they communicate within the brain

- Cannabis increases the noise in your brain

- Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. A new study shows that this active ingredient increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.

-  They found that the runners cartilage seemed to degrade during the first 2500 km of the race.
But after that distance  around 60 marathons  the cartilage seemed to recover

- brains seemed to temporarily shrink in size by 6 per cent over the course of the race

- total recovery after six months
