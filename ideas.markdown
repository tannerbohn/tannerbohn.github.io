  - Neuroscience/Meta
    - how to avoid catastrophic learning?
      - how does the brain do it? store info in both hippocampus and cortex
      - each neuron or connection has its own learning rate -- older memories change less?x
    - evolve strategy for neurons modifying their connections
    - self-optimizing program/AIc
    - create "learning" optimization algorithm -- ex. genetic algorithm that improves ability to evolve
    - what function would "brain waves" have in an ANN?
      - "communication through synchronization"
      - duing deep sleep, signals sent from hippocampus -> thalamus -> cortex hundreds of times
  - pattern recognition
    - feed instances of pattern(s) through autoencoder, then use clustering algorithm to detect unique families of patterns
      - use to study contagion dynamics - recognize distinct behaviours
      - train autoencoder on prev data, and whenever reconstruction error is high, there is a potential outlier
  - determine what foods to eat -- inputs?
  - Generative Adversarial Networks
    - apply to text?
    - try generate more of my art
  - create prediction program for PrKr
    - run day vectors through autoencoder to find clusters
    - represent day as vector and convert to colour/shape
      - find important values that describe day (exercise, mood, sleep, working) and find conversion to colour/shape
        - characterize each month by a form
    - determine activities which maximize mood?
  - learn to simulate chaotic systems (learn transition matrix?)
    - ex. weather?
  - learn to predict continued fraction values -- try find closed forms?
  - learn optimal function interpolator
- Fermi
  - basic drives, morals, and emotions
  - learning "pet" algorithm/program
  - convert words to notes/freqs
  - how do you impart love?
    - how do you get a human to form an attachment to someone or something? or convince them that it has thoughts and feelings
      - anthropomorphization
      - eye contact -> oxytocin
      - dogs, shared intentionality (pointing)
      - study attachment theory
  - convert between mood and line shape

  - Image multiplier (Encryption?) Prime images?
  - Interpolation/extrapolation with ASMD
    - what functions do the ASMD produce?
  - closed forms of general continued fractions
  - geometrically motivated number system (baseless?)
  - make recursive ASMD algorithm more flexible
    - loosen bounds to approximately match sequences (apply to fuzzier data)
  - function modifier for numerical integration accuracy
    - transform curve to smooth bumps -- converge to more smooth or uniform curve?
  - improve image multiscale entropy algorithm
    - normalize to max/min possible
- Images #y
  - convert image to algorithm, recursively apply
    - how to ensure fixed point existence? -- if none, can view time series
  - convert simulation to image
    - represent state as a position in image as well as colour
    - for each position in image, convert to state alpha, see what state alpha goes to (beta), and colour the position of alpha as beta's colour
  - use symmetry & asymmetry rules tos generate image
  - algorithm image isomorphism/conversions
    - come up with extended set of cellular automata rules to use and combine to create images
    - image encodes a particle behaviour
      - interpret as a cellular automata definition
      - convert to lower resolution and parse into cellular automata rules
- Philosophy
  - What does it mean for a pattern/identity to exist?
- Art
  - new letter->wave/shape conversion
    - still aesthetic, but easier to understand
  - create map of sense conversions
    - list all forms of synaesthesia and use transitivity to convert from one sense to another not directly connected
  - given colour palette -> construct piece of music
  - what does it mean to "add", "subtract", or "multiply" short pieces of music
    - create pieces of music based on smaller pieces -- able to create structure?
      - come up with lots of aesthetic short tunes and analyse to try find patterns
      - function to measure devotion to a single key?
  - have grid of all genres and generate heat map based on how often I listen to each one
- Optimization
  - road crossing problem
    - If you want to cross the road to get from A to B, what is the optimal path to take?
    - To minimize time on road, take straight line across road.
      - What does the path look like for partial weighting?
  - design *optimal* comparative sorting algorithm
    - best method for overall accuracy (of three tested) is to split all choices into groups of 4, then choose best from each group, then put each of the winners in a new group.
      - easily generalizable -- but how do you sort all items (instead of just finding the single best)?
    - repeatedly show user subset of data and have them approximately rank them, then use PageRank-like algorithm
    - Is the purpose to actually sort or for a group of people/person to choose a single best item?
